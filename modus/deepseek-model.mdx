DeepSeek is an AI lab that has developed and released a series of open source
LLMs that are notable for both their performance and cost-efficiency. By using a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) system that utilizes only 37 billion of the models' 671
billion parameters for any task, the DeepSeek-R1 model is able to achieve best
in class performance at a fraction of cost of inference on other comparable
models. In this guide we review how to leverage the DeepSeek models using Modus.

## Options for using DeepSeek with Modus

There are two options for invoking DeepSeek models in your Modus app:

1. [Use the distilled DeepSeek model hosted by Hypermode](#using-the-distilled-deepseek-model-hosted-by-Hypermode)
   Hypermode hosts and makes available the distilled DeepSeek model which can be
   used by Modus apps developed locally and deployed to Hypermode
2. [Use the DeepSeek API with your Modus app](#using-the-deepseek-api-with-modus)
   Access DeepSeek models hosted on the DeepSeek platform by configuring a
   DeepSeek connection in your Modus app and using your DeepSeek API key

## Using the distilled DeepSeek model hosted by Hypermode

TODO: explain what a distilled model is

```json modus.json
"deepseek-r1-distill": {
   "sourceModel": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B",
   "provider": "hugging-face",
   "connection": "hypermode"
}
```

## Using the DeepSeek API with Modus

```json modus.json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.hypermode.com/modus.json",
  "endpoints": {
    "default": {
      "type": "graphql",
      "path": "/graphql",
      "auth": "bearer-token"
    }
  },
  "models": {

      "connection": "deepseek",
      "path": "v1/chat/completions"
    }
  },

      }
    }
