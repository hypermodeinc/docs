{/* <!-- vale Google.Passive = NO --> */}

A Modus app is organized into a set of files and directories that define the
structure of your app. This structure is important for maintaining and scaling
your app as it grows.

{/* <!-- vale Google.Passive = YES --> */}

## Structure

Modus fits within the natural language structure of your app code, with
configuration separated from your source code.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Go
.
├── main.go
├── ...
├── modus.json
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

```bash AssemblyScript
.
├── assembly
    ├── index.ts
    ├── ...
    └── tsconfig.json
├── modus.json
├── asconfig.json
├── package.json
└── package-lock.json
```

</CodeGroup>

## App manifest

The `modus.json` [app manifest](/modus/app-manifest) is the central
configuration file for your Modus app. It defines the endpoints, connections,
models, and collections that your code has available to it during runtime.
Because Modus is a secure-by-default framework, only the resources defined in
this file are accessible to your app.

## Initializing your app

When you initialize your app with the `modus new` command, the Modus CLI
scaffolds your app with the necessary files and directories.
