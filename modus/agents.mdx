## Agents in Modus

Agents in Modus are elite operatives that maintain persistent memory across
missions. Unlike stateless functions that lose everything when operations end,
agents remember every detail, survive system failures, and never lose their
operational context.

## Key characteristics

- **Stateful**: Maintains memory and context across interactions
- **Persistent**: Automatically saves and restores state
- **Resilient**: Graceful recovery from failures
- **Autonomous**: Can operate independently over extended periods
- **Actor-based**: Each agent instance runs in isolation
- **Event-driven**: Streams real-time updates and operational intelligence

## When to deploy agents

Agents are perfect for:

- **Multi-turn workflows** spanning multiple interactions
- **Long-running processes** that maintain context over time
- **Stateful operations** that need to remember previous actions
- **Complex coordination** between different system components
- **Persistent monitoring** that tracks changes over time
- **Real-time operations** requiring live status updates and event streaming

## Agent structure

Every agent starts with the essential operational framework:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
    "time"
    "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/agents"
    "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/models"
    "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/models/openai"
)

type IntelligenceAgent struct {
    agents.AgentBase

    // The rest of the fields make up the agent's state and can be customized per agent
    intelligenceReports []string     // Matrix surveillance data
    threatLevel         float64      // Current threat assessment
    lastContact         time.Time
    currentMission      *MissionPhase // Track long-running operations
    missionLog          []string     // Operational progress log
}

type MissionPhase struct {
    Name        string
    StartTime   time.Time
    Duration    time.Duration
    Complete    bool
}

func (a *IntelligenceAgent) Name() string {
    return "IntelligenceAgent"
}
```

The agent embeds `agents.AgentBase`, which provides all the infrastructure for
state management, secure communications, and mission persistence. Your
operational data—intelligence reports, threat assessments, contact logs—lives as
fields in the struct, automatically preserved across all interactions.

## Spawning agents through functions

Agents are deployed through regular Modus functions that become part of your
GraphQL API. These deployment functions create and manage agent instances on
demand:

```go
// Register your agent type during initialization
func init() {
    agents.Register(&IntelligenceAgent{})
}

// Deploy a new agent instance - this becomes a GraphQL mutation
func DeployAgent() (string, error) {
    agentInfo, err := agents.Start("IntelligenceAgent")
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    // Return the agent ID - clients must store this to communicate with the agent
    return agentInfo.Id, nil
}
```

When you call this function through GraphQL, it returns a unique agent ID:

```graphql
mutation {
  deployAgent
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "deployAgent": "agent_neo_001"
  }
}
```

You can think of an Agent as a persistent server process with durable memory.
Once deployed, you can reference your agent by its ID across sessions, page
reloads, and even system restarts. The agent maintains its complete state and
continues operating exactly where it left off.

<Note>
  **Agent builders and visual workflows:** We're actively developing Agent
  Builder tools and "eject to code" feature that generates complete agent
  deployments from visual workflows. These tools automatically create the
  deployment functions and agent management code for complex multi-agent
  systems.
</Note>

## Communicating with your agent

Once deployed, you communicate with your agent using its unique ID. Create
functions that send messages to specific agent instances:

```go
func ImportActivity(agentId string, activityData string) (string, error) {
    result, err := agents.SendMessage(
        agentId,
        "matrix_surveillance",
        agents.WithData(activityData),
    )
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    if result == nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("no response from agent")
    }
    return *result, nil
}

func GetThreatStatus(agentId string) (string, error) {
    result, err := agents.SendMessage(agentId, "threat_assessment")
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    if result == nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("no response from agent")
    }
    return *result, nil
}
```

These functions become GraphQL mutations that you can call with your agent's ID:

```graphql
mutation {
  importActivity(
    agentId: "agent_neo_001"
    activityData: "Anomalous Agent Smith replication detected in Sector 7"
  )
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "importActivity": "Matrix surveillance complete.
      Agent Smith pattern matches previous incident in the Loop.
      Threat level: 0.89 based on 3 intelligence reports.
      Recommend immediate evasive protocols."
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  getThreatStatus(agentId: "agent_neo_001")
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getThreatStatus": "Current threat assessment:
      3 intelligence reports analyzed.
      Threat level: 0.89.
      Agent operational in the Matrix."
  }
}
```

The agent receives the message, processes it using its internal state and AI
reasoning, updates its intelligence database, and returns a response—all while
maintaining persistent memory of every interaction.

## Agent message handling

Agents process operational directives through their secure message handling
system:

```go
func (a *IntelligenceAgent) OnReceiveMessage(
    msgName string,
    data *string,
) (*string, error) {
    switch msgName {
    case "matrix_surveillance":
        return a.analyzeMatrixActivity(data)
    case "background_reconnaissance":
        return a.performBackgroundRecon(data)
    case "threat_assessment":
        return a.getThreatAssessment()
    case "get_status":
        return a.getOperationalStatus()
    case "intelligence_history":
        return a.getIntelligenceHistory()
    default:
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("unrecognized directive: %s", msgName)
    }
}
```

Each directive triggers specific operational procedures, with all intelligence
automatically maintained in the agent's secure memory.

## Processing operations with AI intelligence

Here's how agents handle field operations while maintaining persistent state and
using AI models for analysis:

```go
func (a *IntelligenceAgent) analyzeMatrixActivity(data *string) (*string, error) {
    // Store new intelligence in persistent memory
    a.intelligenceReports = append(a.intelligenceReports, *data)
    a.lastContact = time.Now()

    // Build context from all accumulated intelligence
    context := strings.Join(a.intelligenceReports, "\n")

    // AI analysis using complete operational history
    model, _ := models.GetModel[openai.ChatModel]("analyst-model")

    systemPrompt := `You are a resistance operative in the Matrix.
        Analyze patterns from accumulated surveillance reports
        and provide threat assessment for anomalous Agent behavior.`

    userPrompt := fmt.Sprintf(`All Matrix Intelligence:
        %s

        Provide threat assessment:`,
        context)

    input, _ := model.CreateInput(
        openai.NewSystemMessage(systemPrompt),
        openai.NewUserMessage(userPrompt),
    )

    output, _ := model.Invoke(input)
    analysis := output.Choices[0].Message.Content

    // Update threat level based on data volume and AI analysis
    a.threatLevel = float64(len(a.intelligenceReports)) / 10.0
    if a.threatLevel > 1.0 {
        a.threatLevel = 1.0
    }

    // Boost threat level for critical AI analysis
    if strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(analysis), "critical") ||
       strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(analysis), "agent smith") {
        a.threatLevel = math.Min(a.threatLevel + 0.2, 1.0)
    }

    result := fmt.Sprintf(`Matrix surveillance complete:
        %s

        (Threat level: %.2f based on %d intelligence reports)`,
        analysis,
        a.threatLevel,
        len(a.intelligenceReports))
    return &result, nil
}
```

This demonstrates how agents maintain state across complex operations while
using AI models with the full context of accumulated intelligence.

## The power of intelligent persistence

This combination creates agents that:

<Note>
  **First Analysis:** "Anomalous activity detected. Limited context available.
  (Threat level: 0.10 based on 1 intelligence report)"
</Note>

<Note>
  **After Multiple Reports:** "Pattern confirmed across 5 previous incidents.
  Agent Smith replication rate exceeding normal parameters. Immediate extraction
  recommended. (Threat level: 0.89 based on 8 intelligence reports)"
</Note>

The agent doesn't just remember—it **learns and becomes more intelligent with
every interaction**. AI models see the complete operational picture, enabling
sophisticated pattern recognition impossible with stateless functions.

## State persistence

Agents automatically preserve their operational state through Modus's built-in
intelligence management:

```go
func (a *IntelligenceAgent) GetState() *string {
    reportsData := strings.Join(a.intelligenceReports, "|")
    state := fmt.Sprintf("%.2f|%s|%d",
        a.threatLevel,
        reportsData,
        a.lastContact.Unix())
    return &state
}

func (a *IntelligenceAgent) SetState(data *string) {
    if data == nil {
        return
    }

    parts := strings.Split(*data, "|")
    if len(parts) >= 3 {
        a.threatLevel, _ = strconv.ParseFloat(parts[0], 64)
        if parts[1] != "" {
            a.intelligenceReports = strings.Split(parts[1], "|")
        }
        timestamp, _ := strconv.ParseInt(parts[2], 10, 64)
        a.lastContact = time.Unix(timestamp, 0)
    }
}
```

## Agent lifecycle

Agents have built-in operational protocols for mission continuity:

```go
func (a *IntelligenceAgent) OnInitialize() error {
    // Called when agent is first awakened in the Matrix
    a.lastContact = time.Now()
    a.threatLevel = 0.0

    fmt.Printf(`Resistance Agent %s awakened
        and ready for Matrix surveillance`, a.Id())
    return nil
}

func (a *IntelligenceAgent) OnResume() error {
    // Called when agent reestablishes contact with complete intel intact
    fmt.Printf(`Agent back online in the Matrix.
        %d intelligence reports processed.
        Threat level: %.2f`,
        len(a.intelligenceReports),
        a.threatLevel)
    return nil
}

func (a *IntelligenceAgent) OnSuspend() error {
    // Called before agent goes dark
    return nil
}

func (a *IntelligenceAgent) OnTerminate() error {
    // Called before final extraction from the Matrix
    fmt.Printf(`Agent %s extracted from Matrix.
        Intelligence archive preserved.`, a.Id())
    return nil
}
```

## Asynchronous operations

For fire-and-forget operations where you don't need to wait for a response,
agents support asynchronous messaging:

```go
func InitiateBackgroundRecon(agentId string, data string) error {
    // Send message asynchronously - agent processes in background
    err := agents.SendMessageAsync(
        agentId,
        "background_reconnaissance",
        agents.WithData(data),
    )
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Operation initiated - agent continues processing independently
    return nil
}
```

This enables agents to handle long-running operations like:

- Background Matrix monitoring with status updates
- Scheduled intelligence gathering
- Multi-phase operations that continue independently
- Autonomous surveillance with alert notifications

## Real-time agent event streaming

For monitoring live operations and receiving real-time intelligence updates,
agents support event streaming through GraphQL subscriptions. This enables your
clients to receive instant notifications about operational changes, mission
progress, and critical alerts.

### Subscribing to agent events

Monitor your agent's real-time activities using the unified event subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
  agentEvents(agentId: "agent_neo_001") {
    type
    payload
    timestamp
  }
}
```

Your agent streams various types of operational events:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "agentEvents": {
      "type": "mission_started",
      "payload": {
        "missionName": "Deep Matrix Surveillance",
        "priority": "HIGH",
        "estimatedDuration": "180s"
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-06-04T14:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "agentEvents": {
      "type": "agent_threat_detected",
      "payload": {
        "threatLevel": "CRITICAL",
        "confidence": 0.92,
        "indicators": ["agent_smith_replication", "unusual_code_patterns"],
        "recommendation": "immediate_extraction"
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-06-04T14:31:15Z"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "agentEvents": {
      "type": "surveillance_progress",
      "payload": {
        "phase": "Processing Matrix surveillance data",
        "progress": 0.65,
        "reportsProcessed": 5,
        "totalReports": 8
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-06-04T14:32:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Emitting events from your agent

Agents can broadcast real-time operational intelligence by emitting events
during their operations. Let's enhance our Matrix surveillance example:

```go
func (a *IntelligenceAgent) analyzeMatrixActivity(
    data *string,
) (*string, error) {
    // Emit mission start event
    a.EmitEvent("mission_started", any{
        "missionName": "Matrix Surveillance Analysis",
        "priority": "HIGH",
        "activityData": len(*data),
    })

    // Store new intelligence in persistent memory
    a.intelligenceReports = append(a.intelligenceReports, *data)
    a.lastContact = time.Now()

    // Emit progress update
    a.EmitEvent("surveillance_progress", any{
        "reportsProcessed": len(a.intelligenceReports),
        "phase": "Processing Matrix surveillance data",
        "progress": 0.3,
    })

    // Build context from all accumulated intelligence
    context := strings.Join(a.intelligenceReports, "\n")

    // AI analysis using complete operational history
    model, _ := models.GetModel[openai.ChatModel]("analyst-model")

    systemPrompt := `You are a resistance operative in the Matrix.
        Analyze patterns from accumulated surveillance reports
        and provide threat assessment for anomalous Agent behavior.`

    userPrompt := fmt.Sprintf(`All Matrix Intelligence:
        %s

        Provide threat assessment:`,
        context)

    input, _ := model.CreateInput(
        openai.NewSystemMessage(systemPrompt),
        openai.NewUserMessage(userPrompt),
    )

    // Emit AI processing event
    a.EmitEvent("ai_analysis_started", any{
        "modelName": "analyst-model",
        "contextSize": len(context),
        "reportCount": len(a.intelligenceReports),
    })

    output, _ := model.Invoke(input)
    analysis := output.Choices[0].Message.Content

    // Update threat level based on data volume and AI analysis
    a.threatLevel = float64(len(a.intelligenceReports)) / 10.0
    if a.threatLevel > 1.0 {
        a.threatLevel = 1.0
    }

    // Check for Agent threats and emit alerts
    if strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(analysis), "critical") ||
       strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(analysis), "agent smith") {
        a.threatLevel = math.Min(a.threatLevel + 0.2, 1.0)
        a.EmitEvent("agent_threat_detected", any{
            "threatLevel": "HIGH",
            "confidence": a.threatLevel,
            "analysis": analysis,
            "recommendation": "immediate_extraction",
        })
    }

    // Emit mission completion
    a.EmitEvent("mission_completed", any{
        "missionName": "Matrix Surveillance Analysis",
        "confidence": a.threatLevel,
        "reportsAnalyzed": len(a.intelligenceReports),
        "status": "SUCCESS",
    })

    result := fmt.Sprintf(`Matrix surveillance complete:
        %s

        (Threat level: %.2f based on %d intelligence reports)`,
        analysis,
        a.threatLevel,
        len(a.intelligenceReports))
    return &result, nil
}
```

### Event-driven operational patterns

This streaming capability enables sophisticated real-time operational patterns:

**Live Mission Dashboards**: build real-time command centers that show agent
activities, mission progress, and threat alerts as they happen.

**Reactive Coordination**: other agents or systems can subscribe to events and
automatically respond to operational changes—enabling true multi-agent
coordination.

**Operational intelligence**: stream events to monitoring systems, alerting
platforms, or data lakes for real-time operational awareness and historical
analysis.

**Progressive Enhancement**: update user interfaces progressively as agents work
through complex, multi-phase operations without polling or manual refresh.

## Monitoring ongoing operations

You can also poll agent status directly through dedicated functions:

```go
func CheckMissionProgress(agentId string) (*MissionStatus, error) {
    result, err := agents.SendMessage(agentId, "get_status")
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    var status MissionStatus
    json.Unmarshal([]byte(*result), &status)
    return &status, nil
}

type MissionStatus struct {
    Phase          string    `json:"phase"`
    Progress       float64   `json:"progress"`
    CurrentTask    string    `json:"current_task"`
    EstimatedTime  int       `json:"estimated_time_remaining"`
    IsComplete     bool      `json:"is_complete"`
}
```

The agent tracks its operational status using the mission state we defined
earlier:

```go
func (a *IntelligenceAgent) getOperationalStatus() (*string, error) {
    var status MissionStatus

    if a.currentMission == nil {
        status = MissionStatus{
            Phase:       "Standby",
            Progress:    1.0,
            CurrentTask: "Awaiting mission directives in the Matrix",
            IsComplete:  true,
        }
    } else {
        // Calculate progress based on mission log entries
        progress := float64(len(a.missionLog)) / 4.0 // 4 phases expected
        if progress > 1.0 { progress = 1.0 }

        status = MissionStatus{
            Phase:       a.currentMission.Name,
            Progress:    progress,
            CurrentTask: a.missionLog[len(a.missionLog)-1], // Latest entry
            IsComplete:  a.currentMission.Complete,
        }
    }

    statusJson, _ := json.Marshal(status)
    result := string(statusJson)
    return &result, nil
}
```

Your client can either poll this status endpoint via GraphQL or subscribe to
real-time events for instant updates:

```graphql
# Polling approach
query MonitorMission($agentId: String!) {
  checkMissionProgress(agentId: $agentId) {
    phase
    progress
    currentTask
    estimatedTimeRemaining
    isComplete
  }
}

# Real-time streaming approach (recommended)
subscription LiveAgentMonitoring($agentId: String!) {
  agentEvents(agentId: $agentId) {
    type
    payload
    timestamp
  }
}
```

The streaming approach provides superior operational intelligence:

- **Instant Updates**: Receive events the moment they occur, not on polling
  intervals
- **Rich Context**: Events include detailed payload data about operational state
- **Event Filtering**: Subscribe to specific agent IDs and filter event types
  client-side
- **Operational History**: Complete timeline of agent activities for audit and
  debugging
- **Scalable Monitoring**: Monitor multiple agents simultaneously with
  individual subscriptions

## Agent workflow example

1. Client calls `DeployAgent()` → receives agent ID `"agent_neo_001"`
2. Client stores `"agent_neo_001"` for future communications
3. Client subscribes to real-time events:
   `agentEvents(agentId: "agent_neo_001")`
4. Client calls
   `ImportActivity("agent_neo_001", "anomalous Agent Smith replication detected")`
   → agent stores data, emits events, and uses AI to analyze patterns
5. Client receives real-time events: mission started, analysis progress, threat
   alerts
6. Agent invokes AI model with accumulated context → generates sophisticated
   threat assessment and streams completion events
7. Client calls `GetThreatStatus("agent_neo_001")` → agent returns AI-powered
   analysis from persistent memory
8. For long-running analysis, client calls
   `InitiateBackgroundRecon("agent_neo_001", data)` → agent processes
   asynchronously while streaming progress events
9. Client monitors real-time progress through event subscription without polling
10. Agent persists across system restarts, maintaining complete intelligence
    database and event streaming capabilities

**Important**: clients must store the agent ID returned from deployment
functions to communicate with that specific agent instance. Each agent maintains
its own independent state and can only be accessed through its unique ID.

## Beyond simple operations

Agents enable sophisticated operational patterns impossible with stateless
functions:

- **Operational continuity**: Maintain mission state across system failures and
  re-deployments
- **Intelligence building**: Accumulate understanding across multiple
  assignments through AI-powered analysis
- **Mission recovery**: Resume operations from last secure checkpoint instead of
  starting over
- **Network coordination**: Manage complex multi-agent operations with shared
  intelligence and real-time event coordination
- **Adaptive learning**: AI models become more effective as agents accumulate
  operational data
- **Real-time streaming**: Broadcast operational intelligence instantly to
  monitoring systems and coordinating agents
- **Event-driven coordination**: React to operational changes and mission
  updates through real-time event streams
- **Progressive operations**: Update user interfaces and trigger downstream
  processes as agents work through complex missions

Agents represent the evolution from stateless functions to elite operatives that
maintain complete operational continuity, build intelligence over time, and
provide real-time operational awareness. They're the foundation for building
intelligence networks that never lose track of their missions, become smarter
with every interaction, and keep operational teams informed through live event
streaming—no matter what happens in the field.
