The SDK provides:

- A project structure to organize your functions
- A set of APIs to interact with data, AI models, and other services
- A local development environment to download dependencies and compile your functions
- A CI/CD workflow that automatically deploys your functions on Hypermode when pushing changes to your repository

<Note>
  The Functions SDK currently includes support for AssemblyScript, a
  TypeScript-like language. Additional language support is in development.
</Note>

The SDK is available at [https://github.com/hypermodeinc/functions-as](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/functions-as).

For inspiration on getting started, reference the [examples in the SDK repository](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/functions-as/tree/main/examples).

## APIs

The following APIs are available in the Functions SDK:

<Tip>
  We're constantly introducing new APIs through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
