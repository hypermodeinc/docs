## What is Modus? {/* vale Google.Contractions = NO */}

Modus is an open source, serverless framework for building intelligent agents
and APIs in Go or AssemblyScript (a TypeScript-like language). Modus is a
runtime purpose-built for orchestrating autonomous AI agents that operate as
first-class citizens in your stack.

You write your app logic in Go or AssemblyScript—whichever you prefer—and Modus
compiles everything to WebAssembly for fast performance at scale and at the
edge. Each agent instance gets a dedicated execution environment, sand-boxed for
resiliency, scalability, and security.

Modus enables both stateless functions for quick API responses and stateful
agents that maintain persistent memory across interactions. This eliminates the
need to parse conversation histories, rebuild context from scratch, or lose
state when errors occur.

You can run Modus locally for development or deploy it in seconds to Hypermode
for production.

## What is Modus good for? {/* vale Google.Contractions = NO */}

Modus is designed for building both traditional functions and intelligent
agents. It supports sub-second response times for stateless operations and
long-running, autonomous workflows that maintain state over time.

**Functions**: stateless operations for API endpoints, data processing, and AI
inference tasks.

**Agents**: stateful entities that maintain conversation history, coordinate
between models and tools, and operate independently over extended periods.
Agents automatically handle state persistence and fault tolerance.

Both can be deployed in the same app, allowing you to choose the right
abstraction for each use case.
