A framework to make intelligent APIs real-time, incrementally adoptable, and universal. 

## Quick Install


```bash
brew install modus
```


## What is This?
This framework is aimed at assisting in the development of intelligent APIs and services.

To build the applications and services we want: applications that are thoughtful, fun, and effective. 

We often need to integrate models (Large Languages Models, Machine Learning Models, Deep Learning Models, etc.) with our application code. 

These applications can be simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) applications that have a model that resolves duplicates, or then can be complex agentic reasoning applications. 

*Standing up services that arrange data, models, and logic into useful chains of inputs, outputs, and loops shouldn’t be difficult.* 


### It aims to create:
1. Strong defaults with infinite customization for managing data, logic, and models that reduce the complexity required to work with non-deterministic systems ("AI"). 
2. Deployment patterns that facilitate sub-second intelligence within user-facing applications.
3. A toolkit that allows teams to incrementally adopt models within their existing applications. 
4. A multi-language framework with a lightweight footprint that makes AI usable for developers with varied needs and sophistication.


### Modus provides:
- A project structure to organize your functions.
- A set of APIs to interact with data, AI models, and other services.
- A local development environment to download dependencies and compile your functions.
- A CI/CD workflow that automatically deploys your functions on [Hypermode](hypermode.com/new) when pushing changes to your repository.

<Note>
Modus is a multi-language framework. It currently includes support for GoLang and AssemblyScript, a WebAssembly compatible TypeScript-like language. Additional language support is in development.

### How is Modus Organized? 

We organize your application into 2 primary components:

- `modus.json` we call this your [Manifest](https://hypermode-modus-docs.mintlify.app/modus/app-manifest). Where you decide what models, data, and external services you’d like your functions to have access to. 
- `/functions/` is where you write your function code. If you're writing in AssemblyScript, you'll publish your functions in the `/assembly/index.ts` file. For Golang, simply capitalizing a function's name will expose it in the Modus API.
