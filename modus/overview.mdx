## What is Modus? {/* vale Google.Contractions = NO */}

Modus is an open source, serverless framework for building functions and APIs,
powered by WebAssembly.

You write your app logic in Go or AssemblyScript, and Modus provides additional
features to easily integrate models, data, and external services.

To **build apps that are thoughtful, fun, and effective**, we often need to
integrate models in different forms, whether generative large language models or
classical machine/deep learning models.

Your app might be a simple create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) function that
has a single model to identify similar entries. Or, it could be a complex
agentic reasoning system that chains dozens of models and data sources together.
**Modus creates a way of working with models that scales with your needs.**

Modus exists to make it easier for you to build the apps of your dreams.

<Note>
  Modus is a multi-language framework. It currently includes support for Go and
  AssemblyScript, a WebAssembly compatible TypeScript-like language. Additional
  language support is in development.

## What is Modus good for? {/* vale Google.Contractions = NO */}

We designed Modus primarily as a general-purpose app framework, it just happens
to treat models as a first-class component. With Modus you can use models, as
appropriate, without additional complexity.

However, Modus is best for apps that require sub-second response times. We've
made trade-offs to optimize for speed and simplicity.
