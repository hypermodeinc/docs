## What is Modus? {/* vale Google.Contractions = NO */}

Modus is an open source, serverless framework for building intelligent agents
and APIs in Go or AssemblyScript (a TypeScript-like language). Modus is a
runtime purpose-built for orchestrating autonomous AI agents that operate as
first-class citizens in your stack.

You write your app logic in Go or AssemblyScript—whichever you prefer—and Modus
compiles everything to WebAssembly for fast performance at scale and at the
edge. Each agent instance gets a dedicated execution environment, sand-boxed for
resiliency, scalability, and security.

Modus enables both stateless functions for quick API responses and stateful
agents that maintain persistent memory across interactions. This eliminates the
need to parse conversation histories, rebuild context from scratch, or lose
state when errors occur.

Modus provides a complete toolkit for building intelligent applications:

- **Functions**: Stateless operations that automatically become shareable skills
  via auto-generated APIs
- **Agents**: Stateful entities with short-term and long-term memory that
  coordinate models, tools, and data
- **Models**: Domain-specific AI models with the ability to easily swap in
  different providers or versions
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Organizational memory that scales context across
  multi-agent architectures

Built-in observability provides automatic inference logging and tracing, while
secure-by-default authorization ensures risk-appropriate access to tools and
data. Following modern best practices for AI-native architectures, Modus
implements principles from the 12-factor agentic app methodology for
maintainable, scalable intelligent systems.

You can run Modus locally for development or deploy it in seconds to Hypermode
for production.

## What is Modus good for? {/* vale Google.Contractions = NO */}

Modus is designed for building applications where AI is at its core capability.
It supports sub-second response times for stateless operations and long-running,
autonomous workflows that maintain state over time.

**Beyond demo prompt apps**: we've all built apps with prompts and AI tool
integrations. When you're ready to take your project to the next level, Modus
serves as your AI component in the stack. Modus can sit right alongside your
existing app, handling the intelligent workflows while your main app focuses on
what it does best.

Both functions and agents can be deployed in the same app, allowing you to
choose the right abstraction for each use case.
