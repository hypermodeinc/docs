---

We built Hypermode first to make the easy things easy. Here you'll find a collection of examples demonstrating how to
implement basic functions using the Modus framework. We designed these examples to help you get started quickly and
understand the core concepts of Modus.

## Set up

Before diving into the examples, make sure you have Modus installed and set up. If you haven't done this yet, please
refer to the [quickstart guide](modus/quickstart).

## Basic function implementations

### Hello world

Learn how to create a simple "Hello World" function using Modus. This example covers the basics of setting up a
function, deploying it, and invoking it.

### Data processing

Explore how to implement a function that processes data. This example demonstrates how to handle input data, perform
operations, and return results.

### API integration

See how to integrate external APIs into your Modus functions. This example shows how to make API calls, handle
responses, and use the data in your functions.

### Database operations

Understand how to perform database operations with Modus. This example covers connecting to a database, executing
queries, and managing data.

## Best practices

- **Modular Code**: Keep your code modular and organized to make it easier to maintain and extend.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to ensure your functions can gracefully handle unexpected
  situations.
- **Logging**: Use logging to track the execution of your functions and troubleshoot issues.
- **Testing**: Write tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected and catch potential issues early.

## Additional resources

Once you've mastered the basics, explore adding intelligence to your app with our
[AI-enabled examples](/modus/ai-enabled-apps).

We hope these examples help you get started with Modus and inspire you to build amazing applications. Happy coding!
