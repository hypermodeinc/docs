## Examples

Welcome to the Modus examples page! Here you'll find a collection of examples demonstrating how to implement basic
functions using the Modus framework. These examples are designed to help you get started quickly and understand the core
concepts of Modus.

### Getting started

Before diving into the examples, make sure you have the Modus CLI installed and set up. If you haven't done this yet,
please refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.hypermode.com/modus/installation).

### Basic function implementations

#### Example 1: hello world

Learn how to create a simple "Hello World" function using Modus. This example covers the basics of setting up a
function, deploying it, and invoking it.

#### Example 2: data processing

Explore how to implement a function that processes data. This example demonstrates how to handle input data, perform
operations, and return results.

#### Example 3: API integration

See how to integrate external APIs into your Modus functions. This example shows how to make API calls, handle
responses, and use the data in your functions.

#### Example 4: database operations

Understand how to perform database operations with Modus. This example covers connecting to a database, executing
queries, and managing data.

### Best practices

- **Modular Code**: Keep your code modular and organized to make it easier to maintain and extend.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to ensure your functions can gracefully handle unexpected
  situations.
- **Logging**: Use logging to track the execution of your functions and troubleshoot issues.
- **Testing**: Write tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected and catch potential issues early.
