Welcome to the Modus troubleshooting guide! This page covers common issues you might encounter, their resolutions, and best practices for triaging issues effectively.

### Common Issues and Resolutions

#### Issue: CLI Hangs During Project Initialization

**Symptoms**: The Modus CLI hangs indefinitely when running `modus init`.

**Resolution**:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of the Modus CLI installed.
2. Check your internet connection.
3. Run the command with the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed output:

   If the issue persists, try deleting the .modus directory in your home folder and re-running the command.
   Issue: Environment Variables Not Loading
   Symptoms: Environment variables defined in .env are not being recognized by your Modus functions.

Verify that the .env file is in the root directory of your project.
Ensure that each variable is defined in the format KEY=VALUE without spaces around the = sign.
Restart your development server to reload the environment variables:
