<SdkHeader language="Go" feature="Models" />

The Modus Models APIs allow you to invoke AI models directly from your
functions, irrespective of the model's host.

Since many models have unique interfaces, the design of the Models APIs are
extremely flexible. An interface and common base type forms the core of the
APIs, which extends to conform to any model's required schema.

The SDK contains both the base types and pre-defined implementations for many
commonly used models. You can either use one of the pre-defined model types, or
can create custom types for any model you like, by following the same pattern as
implemented in the pre-defined models.

<Tip>
For your reference, several complete examples for using the Models APIs are available in
[Model Invoking](/modus/model-invoking).

Each example demonstrates using different types of AI models for different
purposes. However, the Models interface isn't limited to these purposes. You can
use it for any task that an AI model can perform.

</Tip>

## Import

To begin, import the `models` package from the SDK:

```go
import "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/models"
```

You'll also need to import one or more packages for the model you are working
with. For example:

```go
import "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/models/openai"
```

If you would like to request a new model, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/issues). You can also send
a pull request, if you'd like to contribute a new model yourself.

## Models APIs

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

The APIs in the `models` package are below, organized by category.

<SdkTip />

### Functions

#### GetModel

Get a model instance by name and type.

```go
func GetModel[TModel](modelName string) (*TModel, error)
```

<ResponseField name="TModel" required>
  The type of model to return. This can be any struct that implements the
  `Model` interface.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  The name of the model to retrieve. This must match the name of a model defined
  in your project's manifest file.
</ResponseField>

### Types

#### Model

The interface that all Modus models must implement.

```go
type Model[TIn, TOut any] interface {
  Info() *ModelInfo
  Invoke(input *TIn) (*TOut, error)
}
```

<ResponseField name="TIn" required>
  The type of the input data for the model. This can be any type, including a
  custom type defined in your project. It should match the shape of the data
  expected by the model. It's usually a struct.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="TOut" required>
  The type of the output data from the model. This can be any type, including a
  custom type defined in your project. It should match the shape of the data
  returned by the model. It's usually a struct.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Info()" type="method">
  Returns information about the model set by the Modus Runtime when creating the
  instance. See the [`ModelInfo`](#modelinfo) object for more information.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Invoke(input)" type="method">
  Invokes the model with input data and returns the output data.
</ResponseField>

#### ModelBase

The base type for all models that Modus functions can invoke.

<Tip>
  If you are implementing a custom model, you'll need to create a type alias
  based on this struct. You'll also need structs to represent the input and
  output types for your model. See the implementations of the pre-defined models
  in the Modus GitHub repository for examples.
</Tip>

```go
type ModelBase[TIn, TOut any] struct {
  Debug bool
}

// methods
func (ModelBase[TIn, TOut]) Info() *ModelInfo
func (ModelBase[TIn, TOut]) Invoke(input *TIn) (*TOut, error)
```

<ResponseField name="TIn" required>
  The type of the input data for the model. This can be any type, including a
  custom type defined in your project. It should match the shape of the data
  expected by the model. It's usually a struct.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="TOut" required>
  The type of the output data from the model. This can be any type, including a
  custom type defined in your project. It should match the shape of the data
  returned by the model. It's usually a struct.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Debug" type="bool">
  A flag to enable debug mode for the model. When enabled, Modus automatically
  logs the full request and response data to the console. Implementations can
  also use this flag to enable additional debug logging. Defaults to `false`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Info()" type="method">
  Returns information about the model set by the Modus Runtime when creating the
  instance. See the [`ModelInfo`](#modelinfo) object for more information.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Invoke(input)" type="method">
  Invokes the model with input data and returns the output data.
</ResponseField>

#### ModelInfo

Information about a model that's used to construct a `Model` instance. It's also
available from a method on the `Model` interface.

<Info>

This struct relays information from the Modus runtime to the model
implementation. Generally, you don't need to create `ModelInfo` instances
directly.

However, if you are implementing a custom model, you may wish to use a field
from this struct, such as `FullName`, for model providers that require the model
name in the input request body.

</Info>

```go
type ModelInfo struct {
  Name string
  FullName string
}
```

<ResponseField name="Name" type="string">
  The name of the model from the app manifest.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="FullName" type="string">
  The full name or identifier of the model, as defined by the model provider.
</ResponseField>
