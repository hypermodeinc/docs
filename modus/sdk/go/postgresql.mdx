<SdkHeader language="Go" feature="PostgreSQL" />

The Modus PostgreSQL APIs allow you to run queries against PostgreSQL or any
PostgreSQL-compatible database platform.

## Import

To begin, import the `postgresql` namespace from the SDK:

```go
import github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/postgresql
```

## PostgreSQL APIs

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

The APIs in the `postgresql` namespace are below, organized by category.

<SdkTip />

### Functions

#### execute

Execute a SQL statement against a PostgreSQL database, without any data
returned. Use this for insert, update, or delete operations, or for other SQL
statements that don't return data.

<Note>
  The `execute` function is for operations that don't return data. However, some
  insert/update/delete operations may still return data, such as an identifier
  for a newly inserted row. In these cases, you can use the `queryScalar`
  function instead (for a single row's identifier), or the `query` function (for
  multiple rows).
</Note>

```go
function postgresql.execute (
  connectionName: string,
  statement: string,
  params?: Params
): Response
```

<ResponseField name="connectionName" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](../app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>
  SQL statement containing the query or mutation operation to execute.

  <Warning>
    While it's possible to directly include parameter values into your SQL statement, it's
    highly recommended to pass a [`Params`](#params) object instead. This can help to prevent
    against injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
  </Warning>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="params" type="Params">
  Optional parameters to include with the query.

See the details of the [`Params`](#params) object for more information.

</ResponseField>

#### query

Execute a SQL statement against a PostgreSQL database, returning a set of rows.
In the results, each row converts to an object of type `T`, with fields matching
the column names.

```go
function postgresql.query<T>(
  connectionName: string,
  statement: string,
  params?: Params,
): QueryResponse<T>
```

<ResponseField name="T" type="Type" required>
  Type of object to use for the data returned from the query. This can be any type, including a custom
  type defined in your project. It should match the shape of the row returned from the SQL query.

  <Tip>
  Define custom types in the app's source code. In AssemblyScript, create classes decorated with `@json`.

All types, including classes, base classes, and field types must be JSON
serializable. You can also use built-in types such as strings, numbers, arrays,
and maps.

If working with PostgreSQL's `point` data type, you can use a [`Point`](#point)
or [`Location`](#location) object to represent the data.

  </Tip>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connectionName" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](../app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>
  SQL statement containing the query or mutation operation to execute.

  <Warning>
    While it's possible to directly include parameter values into your SQL statement, it's highly
    recommended to pass a [`Params`](#params) object instead. This can help to prevent against
    injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
  </Warning>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="params" type="Params">
  Optional parameters to include with the query.

See the details of the [`Params`](#params) object for more information.

</ResponseField>

#### queryScalar

Execute a SQL statement against a PostgreSQL database, returning a single scalar
value. For example, the result could be a count, sum, or average, or it could be
an identifier.

```go
function postgresql.queryScalar<T> (
  connectionName: string,
  statement: string,
  params?: Params
): ScalarResponse<T>
```

<ResponseField name="T" type="Type" required>
  Type of object to use for the data returned from the query. This should
  generally be a scalar data type, such as a number or string. It should match
  the type of the data returned from the SQL query.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connectionName" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](../app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>
  SQL statement containing the query or mutation operation to execute.

  <Warning>
    While it's possible to directly include parameter values into your SQL statement, it's highly
    recommended to pass a [`Params`](#params) object instead. This can help to prevent against
    injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
  </Warning>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="params" type="Params">
  Optional parameters to include with the query.

See the details of the [`Params`](#params) object for more information.

</ResponseField>

### Objects

#### Params

```go
class Params {
  public push(value: any): void;
  public toJSON(): string;
}
```

A container for parameters to include with a SQL operation.

To use this feature, create a new `Params` object and call the `push` method for
each parameter you want to include. Then pass the object to the `execute`,
`query`, or `queryScalar` function along with your SQL statement.

<ResponseField name="push(value)">
  Push a parameter value into the list included with the SQL operation. The sequence of calls to
  `push` determines the order of the parameters in the SQL statement. This corresponds to the order
  of the `?` placeholders or `$1`, `$2`, etc.

<ResponseField name="value" type="any" required>
  The value of the parameter to include in the SQL operation.

The value can be of any type that's JSON serializable, including strings,
numbers, boolean values, arrays, maps, and custom objects decorated with
`@json`, as long as the database supports it.

{" "}

<Tip>
  If working with PostgreSQL's `Point` data type, you can either pass separate
  parameters for the coordinates and use a `point()` function in the SQL
  statement, or you can pass a [`Point`](#point) or [`Location`](#location)
  object as a single parameter.
</Tip>

</ResponseField>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="toJSON()" type="string">
  Serializes the parameters to a JSON string for inclusion in the SQL operation.
  The SDK functions call this automatically when you pass a `Params` object. You
  typically don't need to call it directly.
</ResponseField>

#### Response

```go
class Response {
  error: string | null;
  rowsAffected: u32;
}
```

Represents the response from an [`execute`](#execute) operation. Also serves as
the base class for `QueryResponse<T>` and `ScalarResponse<T>`.

<ResponseField name="error" type="string | null">
  An error message, if an error occurred during the operation. Otherwise, this
  field is `null`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="rowsAffected" type="u32">
  The number of rows affected by the operation.
</ResponseField>

#### QueryResponse

```go
class QueryResponse<T> {
  error: string | null;
  rowsAffected: u32;
  rows: T[];
}
```

Represents the response from a [`query`](#query) operation.

<ResponseField name="error" type="string | null">
  An error message, if an error occurred during the operation. Otherwise, this
  field is `null`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="rowsAffected" type="u32">
  The number of rows affected by the operation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="rows" type="T[]">
  An array of objects, each representing a row returned from the query. Each
  object has fields corresponding to the columns in the result set.
</ResponseField>

#### ScalarResponse

class ScalarResponse<T> {
  error: string | null;
  rowsAffected: u32;
  value: T;
}
```

Represents the response from a [`queryScalar`](#queryscalar) operation.

  An error message, if an error occurred during the operation. Otherwise, this
  field is `null`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="rowsAffected" type="u32">
  The number of rows affected by the operation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="value" type="T">
  The scalar value returned from the query.
</ResponseField>

#### Point

```go
class Point {
 x: f64,
 y: f64,
}
```

Represents a point in 2D space, having `x` and `y` coordinates. Correctly
serializes to and from PostgreSQL's point type, in (x, y) order.

<Info>
  This class is identical to the [Location](#location) class, but uses different
  field names.
</Info>

<ResponseField name="x" type="f64" required>
  The x coordinate of the point.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="y" type="f64" required>

  This class is identical to the [Point](#point) class, but uses different field
  names.
</Info>

<ResponseField name="longitude" type="f64" required>
