<SdkHeader language="Go" feature="PostgreSQL" />

The Modus PostgreSQL APIs allow you to run queries against PostgreSQL or any
PostgreSQL-compatible database platform.

## Import

To begin, import the `postgresql` package from the SDK:

```go
import "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/postgresql"
```

## PostgreSQL APIs

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

The APIs in the `postgresql` package are below, organized by category.

<SdkTip />

### Functions

#### Execute

Execute a SQL statement against a PostgreSQL database, without any data
returned. Use this for insert, update, or delete operations, or for other SQL
statements that don't return data.

<Note>
  The `Execute` function is for operations that don't return data. However, some
  insert/update/delete operations may still return data. In these cases, you can
  use the `QueryScalar` or `Query` functions instead.
</Note>

```go
func Execute(connection, statement string, params ...any) (*db.Response, error)
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>

SQL statement containing the query or mutation operation to execute.

<Warning>
  While it's possible to directly include parameter values into your SQL
  statement, it's highly recommended to pass parameters as arguments instead.
  This can help to protect injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="params" type="...any">
  Optional parameters to include with the query.
</ResponseField>

#### Query

Execute a SQL statement against a PostgreSQL database, returning a set of rows.
In the results, each row converts to an object of type `T`, with fields matching
the column names.

```go
func Query[T any](connection, statement string, params ...any) (*db.QueryResponse[T], error)
```

<ResponseField name="T" required>

Type of object to use for the data returned from the query. This can be any
type, including a custom type defined in your project. It should match the shape
of the row returned from the SQL query.

<Tip>

Define custom types in the project's source code. All types must be JSON
serializable. You can also use built-in types such as strings, numbers, slices,
and maps.

If working with PostgreSQL's `point` data type, you can use a [`Point`](#point)
or [`Location`](#location) object to represent the data.

</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>

SQL statement containing the query or mutation operation to execute.

<Warning>
  While it's possible to directly include parameter values into your SQL
  statement, it's highly recommended to pass parameters as arguments instead.
  This can help to protect injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="params" type="...any">
  Optional parameters to include with the query.
</ResponseField>

#### QueryScalar

Execute a SQL statement against a PostgreSQL database, returning a single scalar
value. For example, the result could be a count, sum, or average, or it could be
an identifier.

```go
func QueryScalar[T any](connection, statement string, params ...any) (*db.ScalarResponse[T], error)
```

<ResponseField name="T" required>
  Type of object to use for the data returned from the query. This should
  generally be a scalar data type, such as a number or string. It should match
  the type of the data returned from the SQL query.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>

SQL statement containing the query or mutation operation to execute.

<Warning>
  While it's possible to directly include parameter values into your SQL
  statement, it's highly recommended to pass parameters as arguments instead.
  This can help to protect injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="params" type="...any">
  Optional parameters to include with the query.
</ResponseField>

### Types

#### Location

Represents a location on Earth, having `Longitude` and `Latitude` coordinates.

Correctly serializes to and from PostgreSQL's point type, in (longitude,
latitude) order.

<Info>
  This struct is identical to the [Point](#point) struct, but uses different
  field names.
</Info>

```go
type Location struct {
  Longitude float64
  Latitude float64
}
```

<ResponseField name="Longitude" type="float64" required>
  The longitude coordinate of the location, in degrees.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Latitude" type="float64" required>
  The latitude coordinate of the location, in degrees.
</ResponseField>

#### Point

Represents a point in 2D space, having `X` and `Y` coordinates. Correctly
serializes to and from PostgreSQL's point type, in (x, y) order.

<Info>
  This struct is identical to the [Location](#location) struct, but uses
  different field names.
</Info>

```go
type Point struct {
  X float64
  Y float64
}
```

<ResponseField name="X" type="float64" required>
  The X coordinate of the point.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Y" type="float64" required>
  The Y coordinate of the point.
</ResponseField>

#### QueryResponse

Represents the response from a [`Query`](#query) operation.

```go
type QueryResponse[T any] struct {
  RowsAffected uint32
  LastInsertId uint64
  Rows []T
}
```

<ResponseField name="RowsAffected" type="uint32">
  The number of rows affected by the operation, which typically corresponds to
  the number of rows returned.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="LastInsertId" type="uint64">
  This field is available for other database types, but isn't populated for
  PostgreSQL. Instead, use `Query` or `QueryScalar` with a `RETURNING` clause to
  get the last inserted ID.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Rows" type="[]T">
  An slice of objects, each representing a row returned from the query. Each
  object has fields corresponding to the columns in the result set.
</ResponseField>

#### Response

Represents the response from an [`Execute`](#execute) operation.

```go
type Response struct {
  RowsAffected uint32
  LastInsertId uint64
}
```

<ResponseField name="RowsAffected" type="uint32">
  The number of rows affected by the operation, which typically corresponds to
  the number of rows returned.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="LastInsertId" type="uint64">
  This field is available for other database types, but isn't populated for
  PostgreSQL. Instead, use `Query` or `QueryScalar` with a `RETURNING` clause to
  get the last inserted ID.
</ResponseField>

#### ScalarResponse

Represents the response from a [`QueryScalar`](#queryscalar) operation.

```go
type ScalarResponse[T any] struct {
  RowsAffected uint32
  LastInsertId uint64
  Value T
}
```

<ResponseField name="RowsAffected" type="uint32">
  The number of rows affected by the operation, which typically corresponds to
  the number of rows returned.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="LastInsertId" type="uint64">
  This field is available for other database types, but isn't populated for
  PostgreSQL. Instead, use `Query` or `QueryScalar` with a `RETURNING` clause to
  get the last inserted ID.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Value" type="T">
  The scalar value returned from the query.
</ResponseField>
