<SdkHeader language="Go" feature="GraphQL" />

The Modus GraphQL APIs allow you to securely call and fetch data from any
GraphQL endpoint.

## Import

To begin, import the `graphql` package from the SDK:

```go
import github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/graphql
```

## GraphQL APIs

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

The APIs in the `graphql` package are below, organized by category.

<SdkTip />

### Functions

#### Execute

Execute a GraphQL statement to call a query or apply mutation against a GraphQL
endpoint.

```go
Execute[T any](
  connection,
  statement string,
  variables map[string]any
) (*Response[T], error)
```

<ResponseField name="T" required>

Type of object to use for the data returned from the query. This can be any
type, including a custom type defined in your project. It should match the shape
of the data returned from the GraphQL query.

<Tip>
  Define custom types in the project's source code. All types must be JSON
  serializable. You can also use built-in types such as strings, numbers,
  slices, and maps.
</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connection).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>
  GraphQL statement containing the query or mutation operation to execute.

<Warning>
  While it's possible to directly include parameter values into your GraphQL
  statement, it's highly recommended to pass a variables map instead. This can
  help to prevent against injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="variables" type="map[string]any">

Optional variables to include with the query.

The key should be the name of the GraphQL variable. The value can be of any type
that's JSON serializable, including strings, numbers, boolean values, slices,
maps, and custom structs.

</ResponseField>

### Types

#### Response

```go
type Response[T any] struct {
  Errors []ErrorResult
  Data   *T
}
```

A response object from the GraphQL query.

Either `Errors` or `Data` is present, depending on the result of the query.

<ResponseField name="Errors" type="[]ErrorResult">

An slice of errors incurred as part of your GraphQL request, if any.

Each error in the slice is an [`ErrorResult`](#errorresult) object. If there are
no errors, this field is `nil`.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Data" type="*T">

The resulting data selected by the GraphQL operation.

The data is a pointer to an object the type specified in the call to the
`Execute` function. If data is absent due to errors, this field is `nil`.

</ResponseField>

#### ErrorResult

```go
type ErrorResult struct {
  Message   string
  Locations []CodeLocation
  Path      []string
}
```

The details of an error incurred as part of a GraphQL operation.

<ResponseField name="Message" type="string">
  Description of the error incurred.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Path" type="[]string">

Path to the area of the GraphQL statement related to the error.

Each item in the slice represents a segment of the path.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Locations" type="[]CodeLocation">
  An slice of [`CodeLocation`](#codelocation) objects that point to the specific
  location of the error in the GraphQL statement.
</ResponseField>

#### CodeLocation

```go
type CodeLocation struct {
  Line   uint32
  Column uint32
}
```

The location of specific code within a GraphQL statement.

<ResponseField name="Line" type="uint32">
  Line number within the GraphQL statement for the code.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Column" type="uint32">
  Column number within the GraphQL statement for the code.
</ResponseField>
