<SdkHeader language="Go" feature="HTTP" />

The Modus HTTP APIs allow you to securely call and fetch data from an HTTP
endpoint. It's similar to the HTTP
[`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API used in
JavaScript, but with some modifications to work with Modus.

In a future version of Modus, we'll support Go's standard `net/http` package for
making HTTP requests. However, that's currently not supported due to technical
limitations.

<Warning>

As a security measure, you can only call HTTP endpoints that you
[defined in your app's manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections). Any attempt
to access an arbitrary URL, for a connection not defined in your app's manifest,
results in an error.

Additionally, you should use placeholders for connection secrets in the
manifest, rather than hardcoding them in your functions. Enter the values for
each connections' secrets via environment variables or the Hypermode UI. This
ensures that your secrets are securely stored, aren't committed to your
repository, and aren't visible or accessible from your functions code.

</Warning>

## Import

To begin, import the `http` package from the SDK:

```go
import "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/http"
```

## HTTP APIs

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

The APIs in the `http` package are below, organized by category.

<SdkTip />

### Functions

#### Fetch

Invoke an HTTP endpoint to retrieve data or trigger external action.

Returns a [`Response`](#response) object with the HTTP response data.

```go
func Fetch[T *Request | string](
  requestOrUrl T,
  options ...*RequestOptions
) (*Response, error)
```

<ResponseField name="requestOrUrl" type="*Request | string" required>

Either a URL `string` or a pointer to a [`Request`](#request) object, describing
the HTTP request to make.

If a `string`, the operation uses the `GET` HTTP method with no headers other
than those defined in the manifest entry of the connection.

<Note>
  Each request must match to a connection entry in the manifest, using the
  `baseUrl` field. The request URL passed to the `Fetch` function (or via a
  `Request` object) must start with the manifest entry's `baseUrl` value to
  match.
</Note>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="options" type="*RequestOptions">
  An optional pointer to a [`RequestOptions`](#requestoptions) object with
  additional options for the request, such as the HTTP method, headers, and
  body.
</ResponseField>

#### NewContent

Creates a new [`Content`](#content) object from the given `value`, and returns a
pointer to it.

```go
func NewContent(value any) *Content
```

<ResponseField name="value" required>

The value to create the `Content` object from. Must be one of the following
types:

- A [`Content`](#content) object, or a pointer to one.
- A `[]byte` of binary content, or a pointer to one.
- A `string` of text content.

</ResponseField>

#### NewHeaders

Creates a new [`Headers`](#headers) object from the given `value`, and returns a
pointer to it.

```go
func NewHeaders[T [][]string | map[string]string | map[string][]string](
  value T
) *Headers
```

<ResponseField name="value" type="[][]string | map[string]string | map[string][]string" required>

The value object to create the [`Headers`](#headers) object from. Must be one of
the following types:

- A `[][]string`, where each inner slice contains a header name and value.
- A `map[string]string`, where the keys are header names and the values are
  header values.
- A `map[string][]string`, where the keys are header names and the values are
  slices of header values.

</ResponseField>

#### NewRequest

Creates a new [`Request`](#request) object with the given `url` and `options`,
and returns a pointer to it.

```go
func NewRequest(url string, options ...*RequestOptions) *Request
```

<ResponseField name="url" type="string" required>
  The fully qualified URL of the request, including the protocol. For example,
  `"https://example.com"`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="options" type="*RequestOptions">
  An optional pointer to a [`RequestOptions`](#requestoptions) object that's
  used to set the HTTP method, headers, and body if needed.
</ResponseField>

### Types

#### Content

Represents content used in the body of an HTTP request or response.

<Tip>
  Use the [`NewContent`](#newcontent) function to create a new `Content` object.
</Tip>

```go
type Content struct {
  // no exported fields
}

// methods
func (*Content) Bytes() []byte
func (*Content) Text() string
func (*Content) JSON(result any) error
```

<ResponseField name="Bytes()">
  Returns the binary content as a byte slice.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Text()">
  Interprets the content as a UTF-8 encoded string, and returns it as a `string`
  value.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="JSON(result any) error">

Interprets the content as a UTF-8 encoded string containing JSON, and attempts
to deserialize it into the `result` provided.

Pass the `result` as a pointer to an object matching the shape of the JSON. For
example:

```go
var data MyData
if err := content.JSON(&data); err != nil {
  // handle error
}
```

</ResponseField>

#### Header

Represents an HTTP request or response header.

```go
type Header struct {
  Name   string
  Values []string
}
```

<ResponseField name="Name" type="string">
  The name of the header.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Values" type="[]string">
  An slice of values for the header. Typically a header has a single value, but
  some headers can have multiple values.
</ResponseField>

#### Headers

Represents a collection of HTTP headers.

<Tip>
  Use the [`NewHeaders`](#newheaders) function to create a new `Headers` object.
</Tip>

```go
type Headers struct {
  // no exported fields
}

// methods
func (*Headers) Append(name, value string)
func (*Headers) Entries() [][]string
func (*Headers) Get(name string) *string
```

<ResponseField name="Append(name, value)">
  Appends a new header with the given `name` and `value` to the collection.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Entries()">
  Returns a `[][]string`, where each inner slice contains a header name and
  value.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Get(name)">
  Returns the value of the header with the given `name`, or `nil` if the header
  doesn't exist. If there are multiple values for the header, this function
  concatenates them with a comma to form a single string.
</ResponseField>

#### Request

Represents an HTTP request to make.

<Tip>
  Use the [`NewRequest`](#newrequest) function to create a new `Request` object.
</Tip>

```go
type Request struct {
  Url     string
  Method  string
  Headers *Headers
  Body    []byte
}

// methods
func (*Request) Clone(options ...*RequestOptions) *Request
