<SdkHeader language="Go" feature="Local Time" />

The Modus Local Time APIs allow you to access the user's local time and time
zone from your functions.

## Import

To begin, import the `localtime` package from the SDK:

```go
import github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/localtime
```

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

## Local Time APIs

The APIs in the `localtime` package are below.

All time zones use the IANA time zone database format. For example,
`"America/New_York"`. You can find a list of valid time zones
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

<Info>

{/* <!-- vale Google.Passive = NO --> */}

For APIs that work with the user's local time, the time zone is determined in
the following order of precedence:

- If the `X-Time-Zone` header is present in the request, the time zone is set to
  the value of the header.
- If the `TZ` environment variable is set on the host, the time zone is set to
  the value of the variable.
- Otherwise, the time zone is set to the host's local time zone.

{/* <!-- vale Google.Passive = YES --> */}

</Info>

<Tip>

When working locally with `modus dev`, Modus uses the host's local time zone by
default. You can override this by setting the `TZ` environment variable in your
`.env.local` file.

</Tip>

<Tip>

In a browser-based web app, you can get the user's time zone with the following
JavaScript code:

```js
const timeZone = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone
```

Assign that value to a `"X-Time-Zone"` request header when calling Modus, to use
it for all local time calculations.

</Tip>

<Tip>

In many cases, you can use Go's built-in time support:

```go
// to get the current time in UTC
now := time.Now().UTC()

// if you need a string
s := now.Format(time.RFC3339)
```

</Tip>

<Warning>

Due to Go's WASM implementation, the standard `time.Now()` function always
returns the UTC time, not the user's local time like it usually does in Go. If
you need the user's local time, use `localtime.Now()` instead.

</Warning>

### Functions

#### GetLocation

Returns a pointer to a Go `time.Location` object for a specific time zone.
Errors if the time zone provided is invalid.

```go
func GetLocation(tz string) (*time.Location, error)
```

#### GetTimeZone

Returns the user's time zone in IANA format.

```go
func GetTimeZone() string
```

#### IsValidTimeZone

Determines whether the specified time zone is a valid IANA time zone and
recognized by the system as such.

```go
func IsValidTimeZone(tz string) bool
```

<ResponseField name="tz" type="string" required>
  An IANA time zone identifier, such as `"America/New_York"`.
</ResponseField>

#### Now

Returns the current time as a `time.Time` object, with the location set to the
user's local time zone. Errors if the time zone passed to the host is invalid.

```go
func Now() (time.Time, error)
```

#### NowInZone

Returns the current time as a `time.Time` object, with the location set to a
specific time zone. Errors if the time zone provided is invalid.

```go
func NowInZone(tz string) (time.Time, error)
```

<ResponseField name="tz" type="string" required>
  An IANA time zone identifier, such as `"America/New_York"`.
</ResponseField>
