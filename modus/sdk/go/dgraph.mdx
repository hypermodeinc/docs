<SdkHeader language="Go" feature="Dgraph" />

The Modus Dgraph APIs allow you to run queries and mutations against a Dgraph
database.

## Import

To begin, import the `dgraph` package from the SDK:

```go
import "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/dgraph"
```

## Dgraph APIs

{/* vale Google.Headings = NO */}

The APIs in the `dgraph` package are below, organized by category.

<SdkTip />

### Functions

#### AlterSchema

Alter the schema of a Dgraph database.

```go
func AlterSchema(connection, schema string) error
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="schema" type="string" required>
  The schema to apply to the Dgraph database.
</ResponseField>

#### DropAll

Drop all data from a Dgraph database.

```go
func DropAll(connection string) error
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

#### DropAttr

Drop an attribute from a Dgraph schema.

```go
func DropAttr(connection, attr string) error
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="attr" type="string" required>
  The attribute to drop from the Dgraph schema.
</ResponseField>

#### EscapeRDF

Ensures proper escaping of RDF string literals.

```go
func EscapeRDF(value string) string
```

<ResponseField name="value" type="string" required>
  The RDF string literal to escape.
</ResponseField>

#### ExecuteMutations

Execute one or more mutations, without a filtering query.

<Tip>

If you need to filter the mutations based on a query, use the
[`ExecuteQuery`](#executequery) function instead, and pass the mutations after
the query.

</Tip>

```go
func ExecuteMutations(
  connection string,
  mutations ...*Mutation
) (*Response, error)
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="mutations" type="...*Mutation" required>
  One or more pointers to [`Mutation`](#mutation) objects to execute.
</ResponseField>

#### ExecuteQuery

Execute a DQL query to retrieve data from a Dgraph database.

Also used to execute a filtering query and apply one or more mutations to the
result of the query.

<Tip>

If you need apply mutations _without_ a filtering query, use the
[`ExecuteMutations`](#executemutations) function instead.

</Tip>

```go
func ExecuteQuery(
  connection string,
  query *Query,
  mutations ...*Mutation
) (*Response, error)
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="request" type="*Query*" required>
  A pointer to a [`Query`](#query) object describing the DQL query to execute.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="mutations" type="...*Mutation">
  Optional parameters specifying pointers to one or more [`Mutation`](#mutation)
  objects to execute on the nodes matched by the query.
</ResponseField>

#### NewMutation

Creates a new [`Mutation`](#mutation) object.

```go
func NewMutation() *Mutation
```

#### NewQuery

Creates a new [`Query`](#query) object from a DQL query string.

```go
func NewQuery(query string) *Query
```

<ResponseField name="query" type="string" required>
  The DQL query to execute.
</ResponseField>

### Types

#### Mutation

A Dgraph mutation object, used to execute mutations.

```go
type Mutation struct {
  SetJson   string
  DelJson   string
  SetNquads string
  DelNquads string
  Condition string
}

// methods
func (*Mutation) WithSetJson(json string) *Mutation
func (*Mutation) WithDelJson(json string) *Mutation
func (*Mutation) WithSetNquads(nquads string) *Mutation
func (*Mutation) WithDelNquads(nquads string) *Mutation
func (*Mutation) WithCondition(cond string) *Mutation
```

<ResponseField name="SetJson" type="string">
  A JSON string representing the data to set in the mutation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="DelJson" type="string">
  A JSON string representing the data to delete in the mutation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="SetNquads" type="string">
  A string representing the data to set in the mutation in RDF N-Quads format.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="DelNquads" type="string">
  A string representing the data to delete in the mutation in RDF N-Quads
  format.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Condition" type="string">
  A string representing the condition query for the mutation, as a DQL `@if`
  directive.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="condition" type="string">
  A string representing the condition query for the mutation, as a DQL `@if`
  directive.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="WithSetJson(json)">
  Sets the `SetJson` field of the mutation to the given `json` string. Returns
  the `Mutation` object to allow for method chaining.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="WithDelJson(json)">
  Sets the `DelJson` field of the mutation to the given `json` string. Returns
  the `Mutation` object to allow for method chaining.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="WithSetNquads(nquads)">
  Sets the `SetNquads` field of the mutation to the given `nquads` string.
  Returns the `Mutation` object to allow for method chaining.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="WithDelNquads(nquads)">
  Sets the `DelNquads` field of the mutation to the given `nquads` string.
  Returns the `Mutation` object to allow for method chaining.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="WithCondition(cond)">
  Sets the `condition` field of the mutation to the given `cond` string, which
  should be a DQL `@if` directive. Returns the `Mutation` object to allow for
  method chaining.
</ResponseField>

#### Query

A Dgraph query object, used to execute queries.

```go
type Query struct {
  Query     string
  Variables map[string]string
}

// methods
func (*Query) WithVariable(key string, value any) *Query
```

<ResponseField name="Query" type="string">
  The DQL query to execute.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Variables" type="map[string]string">
  A map of query variables, with values encoded as strings.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="WithVariable(name, value)">

Sets a query variable with the given `name` and `value`. `name` is of type
`string`, and `value` can be a string, number, or boolean.

Returns the `*Query` object to allow for method chaining.

<Tip>

The `WithVariable` method is the preferred way to set query variables in a
`Query` object, and allows for fluent method chaining to add multiple variables.
For example:

```go
query := NewQuery(`
  query all($name: string, $age: int) {
    all(func: eq(name, $name)) {
      name
      age
    }
  }
`).
  WithVariable("name", "Alice").
  WithVariable("age", 30)

response := dgraph.ExecuteQuery("my-dgraph-connection", query)
```

</Tip>

</ResponseField>

#### Request

A Dgraph request object, used to execute queries and mutations.

<Info>

{/* vale Google.Passive = NO */}

This object was used by the `Execute` function, which has been replaced by the
[`ExecuteQuery`](#executequery) and [`ExecuteMutations`](#executemutations)
functions. You should no longer need to create a `Request` object directly.

{/* vale Google.Passive = YES */}

</Info>

```go
type Request struct {
  Query     *Query
  Mutations []*Mutation
}
```

<ResponseField name="Query" type="*Query">
  A pointer to a Dgraph [`query`](#query) object.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Mutations" type="[]*Mutation">
  An slice of pointers to Dgraph [`mutation`](#mutation) objects.
</ResponseField>
