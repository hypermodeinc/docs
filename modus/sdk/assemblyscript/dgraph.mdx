<SdkHeader language="AssemblyScript" feature="Dgraph" />

The Modus Dgraph APIs allow you to run queries and mutations against a Dgraph
database.

## Import

To begin, import the `dgraph` namespace from the SDK:

```ts
import { dgraph } from "@hypermode/modus-sdk-as"
```

## Dgraph APIs

{/* vale Google.Headings = NO */}

The APIs in the `dgraph` namespace are below, organized by category.

<SdkTip />

### Functions

#### alterSchema

Alter the schema of a Dgraph database.

```ts
function alterSchema(connection: string, schema: string): string
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="schema" type="string" required>
  The schema to apply to the Dgraph database.
</ResponseField>

#### dropAll

Drop all data from a Dgraph database.

```ts
function dropAll(connection: string): string
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

#### dropAttr

Drop an attribute from a Dgraph schema.

```ts
function dropAttr(connection: string, attr: string): string
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="attr" type="string" required>
  The attribute to drop from the Dgraph schema.
</ResponseField>

#### escapeRDF

Ensures proper escaping of RDF string literals.

```ts
function escapeRDF(value: string): string
```

<ResponseField name="value" type="string" required>
  The RDF string literal to escape.
</ResponseField>

#### executeMutations

Execute one or more mutations, without a filtering query.

<Tip>

If you need to filter the mutations based on a query, use the
[`executeQuery`](#executequery) function instead, and pass the mutations after
the query.

</Tip>

```ts
function executeMutations(
  connection: string,
  ...mutations: Mutation[]
): Response
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="mutations" type="...Mutation[]" required>
  One or more [`Mutation`](#mutation) objects to execute.
</ResponseField>

#### executeQuery

Execute a DQL query to retrieve data from a Dgraph database.

Also used to execute a filtering query and apply one or more mutations to the
result of the query.

<Tip>

If you need apply mutations _without_ a filtering query, use the
[`executeMutations`](#executemutations) function instead.

</Tip>

```ts
function executeQuery(
  connection: string,
  query: Query,
  ...mutations: Mutation[]
): Response
```

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="request" type="Query" required>
  A [`Query`](#query) object describing the DQL query to execute.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="mutations" type="...Mutation[]">
  Optional parameters specifying one or more [`Mutation`](#mutation) objects to
  execute on the nodes matched by the query.
</ResponseField>

### Types

#### Mutation

A Dgraph mutation object, used to execute mutations.

```ts
class Mutation {
  setJson: string
  delJson: string
  setNquads: string
  delNquads: string
  condition: string
  withSetJson(json: string): Mutation
  withDelJson(json: string): Mutation
  withSetNquads(nquads: string): Mutation
  withDelNquads(nquads: string): Mutation
  withCondition(cond: string): Mutation
}
```

<ResponseField name="new dgraph.Mutation(setJson, delJson, setNquads, delNquads, condition)">
  Creates a new `Mutation` object with the given `setJson`, `delJson`,
  `setNquads`, `delNquads`, and `condition` fields.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="setJson" type="string">
  A JSON string representing the data to set in the mutation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="delJson" type="string">
  A JSON string representing the data to delete in the mutation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="setNquads" type="string">
  A string representing the data to set in the mutation in RDF N-Quads format.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="delNquads" type="string">
  A string representing the data to delete in the mutation in RDF N-Quads
  format.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="condition" type="string">
  A string representing the condition query for the mutation, as a DQL `@if`
  directive.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="withSetJson(json)">
  Sets the `setJson` field of the mutation to the given `json` string. Returns
  the `Mutation` object to allow for method chaining.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="withDelJson(json)">
  Sets the `delJson` field of the mutation to the given `json` string. Returns
  the `Mutation` object to allow for method chaining.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="withSetNquads(nquads)">
  Sets the `setNquads` field of the mutation to the given `nquads` string.
  Returns the `Mutation` object to allow for method chaining.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="withDelNquads(nquads)">
  Sets the `delNquads` field of the mutation to the given `nquads` string.
  Returns the `Mutation` object to allow for method chaining.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="withCondition(cond)">
  Sets the `condition` field of the mutation to the given `cond` string, which
  should be a DQL `@if` directive. Returns the `Mutation` object to allow for
  method chaining.
</ResponseField>

#### Query

A Dgraph query object, used to execute queries.

```ts
class Query {
  query: string = ""
  variables: Map<string, string> = new Map<string, string>()
  withVariable<T>(name: string, value: T): this
}
```

<ResponseField name="new dgraph.Query(query, variables)">
  Creates a new `Query` object with the given `query` and `variables`. `query`
  is a Dgraph Query Language (DQL) query string, and `variables` is an optional
  [`Variables`](#variables) object.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="query" type="string">
  The DQL query to execute.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="variables" type="Map<string, string>">
  A map of query variables, with values encoded as JSON strings.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="withVariable(name, value)">

Sets a query variable with the given `name` and `value`. `name` is of type
`string`, and `value` can be a string, number, or boolean.

Returns the `Query` object to allow for method chaining.

<Tip>

The `withVariable` method is the preferred way to set query variables in a
`Query` object, and allows for fluent method chaining to add multiple variables.
For example:

```ts
const query = new Query(`
  query all($name: string, $age: int) {
    all(func: eq(name, $name)) {
      name
      age
    }
  }
`)
  .withVariable("name", "Alice")
  .withVariable("age", 30)

const response = dgraph.executeQuery("my-dgraph-connection", query)
```

</Tip>

</ResponseField>

#### Request

A Dgraph request object, used to execute queries and mutations.

<Info>

{/* vale Google.Passive = NO */}

This object was used by the `execute` function, which has been replaced by the
[`executeQuery`](#executequery) and [`executeMutations`](#executemutations)
functions. You should no longer need to create a `Request` object directly.

{/* vale Google.Passive = YES */}

</Info>

```ts
class Request {
  query: Query = new Query()
  mutations: Mutation[] = []
}
```

<ResponseField name="new dgraph.Request(query, mutations)">

Creates a new `Request` object with the given `query` and `mutations`.

The [`query`](#query) and [`mutations`](#mutation) fields are optional and
default to `null`.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="query" type="Query">
  A Dgraph [`query`](#query) object.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="mutations" type="Mutation[]">
  An array of Dgraph [`mutation`](#mutation) objects.
</ResponseField>

#### Variables

A Variables object used to set query variables in a Dgraph query.

<Info>

As of SDK version 0.17.1, it's no longer necessary to explicitly create a
`Variables` object. Instead, use the `withVariable` method on the
[`Query`](#query) object to set query variables.

</Info>

```ts
class Variables {
  set<T>(name: string, value: T): void
  toMap(): Map<string, string>
}
```

<ResponseField name="Variables.set(name, value)">
  Sets a query variable with the given `name` and `value`. `name` is of type
  `string`, and `value` can be a string, number, or boolean.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Variables.toMap()">
  Returns a map of all query variables set in the `Variables` object, with
  values encoded as strings.
</ResponseField>
