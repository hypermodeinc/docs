<SdkHeader language="AssemblyScript" feature="GraphQL" />

The Modus GraphQL APIs allow you to securely call and fetch data from any
GraphQL endpoint.

## Import

To begin, import the `graphql` namespace from the SDK:

```ts
import { http } from "@hypermode/modus-sdk-as"
```

## GraphQL APIs

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

The APIs in the `graphql` namespace are below, organized by category.

<SdkTip />

### Functions

#### execute

Execute a GraphQL statement to call a query or apply mutation against a GraphQL
endpoint.

```ts
function execute<T>(
  connection: string,
  statement: string,
  variables?: Variables,
): Response<T>
```

<ResponseField name="T" required>

Type of object to use for the data returned from the query. This can be any
type, including a custom type defined in your project. It should match the shape
of the data returned from the GraphQL query.

<Tip>

Define custom types in the project's source code. In AssemblyScript, create
classes decorated with `@json`.

All types, including classes, base classes, and field types must be JSON
serializable. You can also use built-in types such as strings, numbers, arrays,
and maps.

</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Name of the connection, as [defined in the
  manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connection).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>

GraphQL statement containing the query or mutation operation to execute.

<Warning>
  While it's possible to directly include parameter values into your GraphQL
  statement, it's highly recommended to pass a [`Variables`](#variables) object
  instead. This can help to prevent against injection attacks and other security
  vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="variables" type="Variables">

Optional variables to include with the query.

See the details of the [`Variables`](#variables) object for more information.

</ResponseField>

### Types

#### Variables

A container for variables to include with a GraphQL operation.

To use this feature, create a new `Variables` object and call the `set` method
for each variable you want to include. Then pass the object to the `execute`
function.

```ts
class Variables {
  set<T>(name: string, value: T): void
  toJSON(): string
}
```

<ResponseField name="set(name, value)">

Set a variable with a name and value to include with the GraphQL operation.

<Expandable title="parameters">
{/* <!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 --> */}

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the variable to include in the GraphQL operation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="value" required>

The value of the variable to include in the GraphQL operation.

The value can be of any type that's JSON serializable, including strings,
numbers, boolean values, arrays, maps, and custom objects decorated with
`@json`.

</ResponseField>

{/* <!-- markdownlint-restore MD046 --> */}

</Expandable>
  
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="toJSON()" type="string">
  Serializes the variables to a JSON string for inclusion in the GraphQL
  operation. The `execute` function calls this automatically when you pass a
  `Variables` object. You typically don't need to call it directly.
</ResponseField>

#### Response

A response object from the GraphQL query.

Either `errors` or `data` is present, depending on the result of the query.

```ts
class Response<T> {
  errors: ErrorResult[] | null
  data: T | null
}
```

<ResponseField name="errors" type="ErrorResult[]">

An array of errors incurred as part of your GraphQL request, if any.

Each error in the array is an [`ErrorResult`](#errorresult) object. If there are
no errors, this field is `null`.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="T">

The resulting data selected by the GraphQL operation.

The data has the type specified in the call to the `execute` function. If data
is absent due to errors, this field is `null`.

</ResponseField>

#### ErrorResult

The details of an error incurred as part of a GraphQL operation.

```ts
class ErrorResult {
  message: string
  locations: CodeLocation[] | null
  path: string[] | null
}
```

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  Description of the error incurred.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="locations" type="CodeLocation[]">
  An array of [`CodeLocation`](#codelocation) objects that point to the specific
  location of the error in the GraphQL statement.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="path" type="string[]">

Path to the area of the GraphQL statement related to the error.

Each item in the array represents a segment of the path.

</ResponseField>

#### CodeLocation

The location of specific code within a GraphQL statement.

```ts
class CodeLocation {
  line: u32
  column: u32
}
```

<ResponseField name="line" type="u32">
  Line number within the GraphQL statement for the code.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="column" type="u32">
  Column number within the GraphQL statement for the code.
</ResponseField>
