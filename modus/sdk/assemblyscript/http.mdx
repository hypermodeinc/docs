<SdkHeader language="AssemblyScript" feature="HTTP" />

The Modus HTTP APIs allow you to securely call and fetch data from an HTTP
endpoint. It's similar to the HTTP
[`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API used in
JavaScript, but with some modifications to work with Hypermode Functions.

<Warning>

As a security measure, you can only call HTTP endpoints that you
[defined in your app's manifest](/modus/app-manifest#connections). Any attempt
to access an arbitrary URL, for a connection not defined in your app's manifest,
results in an error.

Additionally, you should use placeholders for connection secrets in the
manifest, rather than hardcoding them in your functions. Enter the values for
each connections' secrets via environment variables or the Hypermode UI. This
ensures that your secrets are securely stored, aren't committed to your
repository, and aren't visible or accessible from your functions code.

</Warning>

## Import

To begin, import the `http` namespace from the SDK:

```ts
import { http } from "@hypermode/modus-sdk-as"
```

## HTTP APIs

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

The APIs in the `http` namespace are below, organized by category.

<SdkTip />

### Functions

#### fetch

Invoke an HTTP endpoint to retrieve data or trigger external action.

Returns a [`Response`](#response) object with the HTTP response data.

```ts
function fetch(
  requestOrUrl: string | Request,
  options: RequestOptions = new RequestOptions(),
): Response
```

<ResponseField name="requestOrUrl" type="string | Request" required>

Either a URL `string` or a [`Request`](#request) object, describing the HTTP
request to make.

If a `string`, the operation uses the `GET` HTTP method with no headers other
than those defined in the manifest entry of the connection.

<Note>
  Each request must match to a connection entry in the manifest, using the
  `baseUrl` field. The request URL passed to the `fetch` function (or via a
  `Request` object) must start with the manifest entry's `baseUrl` value to
  match.
</Note>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="options" type="RequestOptions">
  A [`RequestOptions`](#requestoptions) object with additional options for the
  request, such as the HTTP method, headers, and body.
</ResponseField>

### Types

#### Content

Represents content used in the body of an HTTP request or response.

```ts
class Content {
  static from<T>(value: T): Content
  readonly data: ArrayBuffer
  bytes(): Uint8Array
  text(): string
  json<T>(): T
}
```

<ResponseField name="Content.from(value)">

Creates a new `Content` object from the given value.

The value can be of any type that's JSON serializable, including strings,
numbers, boolean values, arrays, maps, and custom objects decorated with
`@json`.

If the value is a `string` or an `ArrayBuffer` it's sent as-is, without JSON
serialization.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="ArrayBuffer">
  The raw binary content data buffer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bytes()">
  Returns the binary content data as a `Uint8Array`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text()">
  Interprets the content as a UTF-8 encoded string, and returns it as a `string`
  value.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="json<T>()">
  Interprets the content as a UTF-8 encoded string containing JSON in the shape
  of type `T`, and returns it as a value of type `T`.
</ResponseField>

#### Header

Represents an HTTP request or response header.

```ts
class Header {
  name: string
  values: string[]
}
```

<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  The name of the header.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="values" type="string[]">
  An array of values for the header. Typically a header has a single value, but
  some headers can have multiple values.
</ResponseField>

#### Headers

Represents a collection of HTTP headers.

```ts
class Headers {
  static from(
    value: string[][] | Map<string, string> | Map<string, string[]>,
  ): Headers
  append(name: string, value: string): void
  entries(): string[][]
  get(name: string): string | null
}
```

<ResponseField name="Headers.from(value)">

Creates a new `Headers` object from the given `value`.

The `value` must be one of the following types:

- A `string[][]`, where each inner array contains a header name and value.
- A `Map<string, string>`, where the keys are header names and the values are
  header values.
- A `Map<string, string[]>`, where the keys are header names and the values are
  arrays of header values.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="append(name, value)">
  Appends a new header with the given `name` and `value` to the collection.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="entries()">
  Returns a `string[][]`, where each inner array contains a header name and
  value.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="get(name)">
  Returns the value of the header with the given `name`, or `null` if the header
  doesn't exist. If there are multiple values for the header, this function
  concatenates them with a comma to form a single string.
</ResponseField>

#### Request

Represents an HTTP request to make.

```ts
class Request {
  constructor(url: string, options?: RequestOptions)
  static clone(request: Request, options: RequestOptions): Request
  readonly url: string
  readonly method: string
  readonly headers: Headers
  readonly body: ArrayBuffer
  bytes(): Uint8Array
  text(): string
  json<T>(): T
}
```

<ResponseField name="new http.Request(url, options?)">

Creates a new `Request` object with the given `url` and `options`.

The required `url` parameter must be a fully qualified URL of the request,
including the protocol. For example, `"https://example.com"`.

The optional `options` parameter is a [`RequestOptions`](#requestoptions) object
that's used to set the HTTP method, headers, and body if needed.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Request.clone(request, options)">
  Creates a new `Request` object by cloning the given `request` and applying the
  `options` to it.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="url" type="string">
  The fully qualified URL of the request, including the protocol. For example,
  `"https://example.com"`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="method" type="string">
  The HTTP method of the request. For example, `"GET"`, `"POST"`, `"PUT"`, or
  `"DELETE"`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="headers" type="Headers">
  The HTTP headers of the request, as a [`Headers`](#headers) object.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="body" type="ArrayBuffer">

The raw binary content data buffer of the request body.

<Tip>
  The request body isn't normally read directly. Instead, use the `bytes`,
  `text` or `json` functions.
</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bytes()">
  Returns the binary content data of the request body as a `Uint8Array`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text()">
  Interprets the request body as a UTF-8 encoded string, and returns it as a
  `string` value.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="json<T>()">
  Interprets the request body as a UTF-8 encoded string containing JSON in the
  shape of type `T`, and returns it as a value of type `T`.
</ResponseField>

#### RequestOptions

Options for the HTTP request.

```ts
class RequestOptions {
  method: string | null
  headers: Headers
  body: Content | null
}
```

<ResponseField name="method" type="string | null">
  The HTTP method of the request. For example, `"GET"`, `"POST"`, `"PUT"`, or
  `"DELETE"`. If `null` (the default), the request uses the `GET` method.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="headers" type="Headers">

The HTTP headers of the request, as a [`Headers`](#headers) object.

<Tip>
  By default, the `RequestOptions` contains an empty `Headers` object which you
  can add headers to using the `append` method.
</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="body" type="Content | null">

Content to pass in the request body, as a [`Content`](#content) object, or
`null` (the default) if there is no body to pass.

<Tip>
  It's generally recommended to supply a `Content-Type` header for any requests
  that have a body.
</Tip>

</ResponseField>

#### Response

Represents the response received from the HTTP server.

```ts
class Response {
  readonly status: u16
  readonly statusText: string
  readonly headers: Headers
  readonly body: ArrayBuffer
  readonly ok: bool
  bytes(): Uint8Array
  text(): string
  json<T>(): T
}
```

<ResponseField name="status" type="u16">
  The HTTP response status code, such as `200` for success.

<Tip>
  The response body isn't normally read directly. Instead, use the `bytes`,
  `text` or `json` functions.
</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ok" type="bool">
  A boolean value indicating whether the response was successful. It's `true` if
  the status code is in the range `200-299`, and `false` otherwise.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bytes()">
  Returns the binary content data of the response body as a `Uint8Array`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text()">
  Interprets the response body content as a UTF-8 encoded string, and returns it
  as a `string` value.
