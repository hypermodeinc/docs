description: "Capture errors and debugging information in your functions."

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

The Console API allows you to capture information from your functions, such as errors and
other information that can help you debug your functions.

<Info>

Unlike other APIs, the Console API is globally available by default in all functions, you don't
need to import it.

</Info>

The Console API mimics the behavior of the AssemblyScript [`console`](https://www.assemblyscript.org/stdlib/console.html)
object, but directs the output to Hypermode as follows:

- All console output is available in the Hypermode UI, in the "Function Runs" section.
- Output from `console.error` is also sent to the GraphQL response.
- Errors thrown with the `throw` keyword are also sent to the GraphQL response.

## Example project

For your reference, an example that uses the Console APIs is available on GitHub in the
`hypermodeinc/functions-as` repository, at [/examples/simple](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/tree/main/sdk/assemblyscript/examples/simple).

You'll also find the Console APIs used throughout other examples in the repository.

## Console APIs

The APIs in the `console` namespace are below, organized by category.

<Tip>
  We're constantly introducing new APIs through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### Assertion Functions

#### assert

Asserts that a condition is true, and logs an error if it's not.

```go
console.assert(assertion: any, message?: string): void
```

<ResponseField name="assertion" type="any" required>

  asserts that the object isn't `null`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  An error message to log, if the assertion is false.
</ResponseField>

### Logging Functions

```go
console.log(message?: string): void
```

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A message you want to log.
</ResponseField>

#### debug

Generate a log message with the "debug" logging level.

```go
console.debug(message?: string): void
```

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A debug message you want to log.
</ResponseField>

#### info

Generate a log message with the "info" logging level.

```go
console.info(message?: string): void
```

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  An informational message you want to log.
</ResponseField>

#### warn

Generate a log message with the "warning" logging level.

```go
console.warn(message?: string): void
```

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A warning message you want to log.
</ResponseField>

#### error

Generate a log message with the "error" logging level.

```go
console.error(message?: string): void
```

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  An error message you want to log.
</ResponseField>

### Timing Functions

#### time

Starts a new timer using the specified label.

```go
console.time(label?: string): void
```

<ResponseField name="label" type="string">
  An optional label for the timer.
</ResponseField>

#### timeLog

Logs the current value of a timer previously started with `console.time`.

```go
console.timeLog(label?: string): void
```

<ResponseField name="label" type="string">
  An optional label for the timer.
</ResponseField>

#### timeEnd

Logs the current value of a timer previously started with `console.time`, and discards the timer.

```go
console.timeEnd(label?: string): void
```

<ResponseField name="label" type="string">
  An optional label for the timer.
</ResponseField>
