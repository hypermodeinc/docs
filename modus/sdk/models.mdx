description: "Invoke AI models from your functions"
---

The Modus Models API allows you to invoke AI models directly from your functions, irrespective of the model's host.

Since many models have unique interfaces, the design of the Models API is extremely flexible. A common base class forms
the core of the API, which extends to conform to any model's required schema.

A separate library, [`models-as`](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/models-as) contains both the base classes and
pre-defined implementations for many commonly used models. You can either use one of the pre-defined classes, or can
create custom classes for any model you like, by extending from the base `Model` class.

## Example project

For your reference, several complete examples for using the Models API are available on GitHub in the
`hypermodeinc/functions-as` repository:

- [/examples/classification](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/tree/main/sdk/assemblyscript/examples/classification)
- [/examples/embedding](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/tree/main/sdk/assemblyscript/examples/embedding)
- [/examples/textgeneration](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/tree/main/sdk/assemblyscript/examples/textgeneration)

Each example demonstrates using different types of AI models for different purposes. However, the Models interface isn't
limited to these purposes. You can use it for any task that an AI model can perform.

<Note>
  Currently, the models interface doesn't support streaming data, either for input or output. For example, you can't use
  it with models that process streaming audio or video, nor provide streaming text output. We plan to address this
  limitation in a future release.
</Note>

## Import

To begin, import the `models` namespace from the SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
import { models } from "@hypermode/modus-sdk-as"
```

```go Go
import github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/models
```

</CodeGroup>

You'll also need to import one or more classes for the model you are working with.

For example:

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
import { ClassificationModel } from "@hypermode/models-as/models/experimental/classification"
```

Refer to the [`hypermodeinc/models-as`](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/models-as/tree/main/src/models) repository for
the full list of available models. We're constantly adding new models, so the list may have grown since you last
checked.

If you would like to request a new model, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/models-as/issues) on
the `models-as` repository. You can also send a pull request, if you'd like to contribute a new model yourself.

</CodeGroup>

## Models APIs

{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

The APIs in the `models` namespace are below, organized by category.

<Tip>
  We're constantly introducing new APIs through ongoing development with early users. [Open an
  issue](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/issues) if you have ideas on what would make Modus even more powerful for
  your next app!
</Tip>

### Functions

#### getModel

Get a model instance by name and type.

```go
models.getModel<T>(modelName: string): T
```

<ResponseField name="T" type="Type" required>
  The type of model to return. This can be any class that extends the `Model` base class.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  The name of the model to retrieve. This must match the name of a model defined in your project's manifest file.
</ResponseField>

### Objects

#### Model

```go
abstract class Model<TInput, TOutput> {
  debug: boolean;
  info: ModelInfo;
  invoke(input: TInput): TOutput;
}
```

The base class for all models that Hypermode functions can invoke.

<Tip>
  If you are implementing a custom model, you should extend this class. You'll also need classes to represent the input
  and output types for your model. See the implementations of the pre-defined models in the `models-as` repository for
  examples.
</Tip>

<ResponseField name="TInput" type="Type" required>
  The type of the input data for the model. This can be any type, including a custom type defined in your project. It
  should match the shape of the data expected by the model. It's usually a class.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="TOutput" type="Type" required>
  The type of the output data from the model. This can be any type, including a custom type defined in your project. It
  should match the shape of the data returned by the model. It's usually a class.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="debug" type="boolean">
  A flag to enable debug mode for the model. When enabled, Hypermode automatically logs the full request and response
  data to the console. implementations can also use this flag to enable additional debug logging. Defaults to `false`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="info" type="ModelInfo">
  Information about the model set by the Hypermode Runtime when creating the instance. See the [`ModelInfo`](#modelinfo)
  object for more information.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="invoke(input)" type="function">
  Invokes the model with input data and returns the output data.
</ResponseField>

#### ModelInfo

```go
class ModelInfo {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly fullName: string;
}
```

Information about a model that's used to construct a `Model` instance. It's also available as a property on the `Model`
class.

<Info>
  This class relays information from the Hypermode Runtime to the model implementation. Generally, you don't need to
  create `ModelInfo` instances directly.

However, if you are implementing a custom model, you may wish to use a property from this class, such as the `fullName`,
for model providers that require the model name in the input request body.

We may add additional properties to this class in the future, as needed.

</Info>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  The name of the model from the Hypermode manifest.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="fullName" type="string">
  The full name or identifier of the model, as defined by the model provider.
</ResponseField>
