Integrating Dgraph in Modus is a powerful solution to expose AI services with
"memory" or to create, maintain and leverage knowledge graphs.

After you have [initialized a Modus app](/modus/quickstart):

1. Provision your environment\
   Run [Dgraph locally](/dgraph/quickstart#locally) or
   [provision a Graph on Hypermode](/dgraph/quickstart#on-hypermode).

1. Declare the connection in the App Manifest\
    Edit the [App Manifest](/modus/app-manifest) to declare a connection to the
   Dgraph instance using the
   [Dgraph connection string](/modus/app-manifest#using-a-dgraph-connection-string).

   For local instance of Dgraph, the connection string is
   `dgraph://localhost:9080`.\
    For a Graph on Hypermode, the connection string is available from the
   Hypermode dashboard.

   Make sure to use a variable for the bearer token so you don't commit secrets
   in your project! \

```json modus.jon with dgraph connection using API_KEY secret
"connections": {
    // This defines a dgraph connection
    // Get the connection string from the Hypermode dashboard.
    // use a variable for bearer token
    "my-dgraph": {
      "type": "dgraph",
      "connString": "dgraph://modus-recipes-backend-hypermode.hypermode.host:443?sslmode=verify-ca&bearertoken={{API_KEY}}"
    }
  }
```

\
Note: you can also define a Dgraph connection
[Using the gRPC target](/modus/app-manifest#using-a-dgraph-grpc-target)
parameter.

1. Set the secrets\
   When working locally set your
   [Environment Secrets](/modus/run-locally#environment-secrets) using a .env
   file.\

   ```json example of .env file for my-dgraph connection
   MODUS_MY_DGRAPH_APY_KEY='<your API Key>'
   ```

   \
   When you app is deployed on Hypermode,
   [Add the connection secrets](/configure-environment#connection-secrets) in
   the Hypermode Console.

1. Use Modus SDK to query and mutate the graph.\
   In your Modus app, use the Modus SDK to
   [fetch data from Dgraph](/modus/data-fetching#dgraph).

## Resources

- [Manage Schema](/graphs/manage-schema) to deploy a schema to your Dgraph
  instance if needed.
- Get inspirations from
  [Modus Recipes](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus-recipes) where you'll
  find examples using Dgraph in Modus.
