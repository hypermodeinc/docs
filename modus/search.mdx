The Hypermode Collections API enables developers to store, retrieve, and search data within collections using both natural language and vector-based search methods.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing search, ensure you have defined a collection in the `hypermode.json` manifest and have a working Hypermode setup.

### Understanding Key Components

- **Collections**: A collection is a storage unit for data, similar to a table in a database. In this example, `myProducts` is the collection used to store product descriptions.
- **Search Methods**: The code defines multiple search methods (`searchMethod1` and `searchMethod2`) that the system uses to query the collection. These methods could be different algorithms or configurations for vector search.

## Add Items to the Collection

First, we need to populate the collection with items (e.g., product descriptions). You can insert individual or multiple items using the `upsert` and `upsertBatch` methods, respectively.

### Add Single Item

Use `collections.upsert` to insert a product description into the collection. If you don't specify a key, a unique key will be generated for you.

```ts
export function addProduct(description: string): string[] {
  const response = collections.upsert("myProducts", null, description);
  return response.keys;
}
```

### Add Multiple Items

To add a batch of product descriptions, use the `collections.upsertBatch` method.

```ts
export function addProducts(descriptions: string[]): string[] {
  const response = collections.upsertBatch("myProducts", [], descriptions);
  return response.keys;
}
```

## Step 2: Generate Embeddings for Text

The search functionality in Hypermode Collections relies on vector embeddings. Each item in the collection must be converted into a vector representation, which is used for vector-based search and comparison.

```ts
export function embed(text: string[]): f32[][] {
  const model = models.getModel<OpenAIEmbeddingsModel>("embeddings");
  const input = model.createInput(text);
  const output = model.invoke(input);
  return output.data.map<f32[]>((d) => d.embedding);
}
```

## Step 3: Implement Natural Language Search

With the products stored, you can now search the collection using natural language. The `collections.search` function computes an embedding for the search query and compares it with the embeddings of the items in the collection.

```ts
export function searchProducts(
  product: string,
  maxItems: i32,
): collections.CollectionSearchResult[] {
  const responseArr: collections.CollectionSearchResult[] = [];
  const searchMethods = ["searchMethod1", "searchMethod2"]; // defined search methods

  for (let i = 0; i < searchMethods.length; i++) {
    const response = collections.search(
      "myProducts",
      searchMethods[i],
      product,
      maxItems,
      true,
    );
    responseArr.push(response);
  }

  return responseArr;
}
```

In this example, the search query is compared with the items using two different search methods (`searchMethod1`, `searchMethod2`). Results for both methods are returned, which gives flexibility for fine-tuning search behavior.

### Search Result Format

Each search returns an array of `CollectionSearchResult`, containing the following fields:

- `collection`: The name of the collection.
- `status`: The status of the operation (e.g., success, error).
- `objects`: The search result items with their text, distance, and score values.

```json
{
  "collection": "myProducts",
  "status": "success",
  "objects": [
    {
      "key": "item-key-123",
      "text": "Sample product description",
      "distance": 0.05,
      "score": 0.95
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 4: Search by Vector

If you want to search using a vector (instead of text), you can retrieve the vector associated with an item by its key, then perform a search using that vector.

```ts
export function searchProductsById(
  productId: string,
  maxItems: i32,
): collections.CollectionSearchResult[] {
  const responseArr: collections.CollectionSearchResult[] = [];
  const searchMethods = ["searchMethod1", "searchMethod2"];

  for (let i = 0; i < searchMethods.length; i++) {
    const vec = collections.getVector(
      "myProducts",
      searchMethods[i],
      productId,
    );
    const response = collections.searchByVector(
      "myProducts",
      searchMethods[i],
      vec,
      maxItems,
      true,
    );
    responseArr.push(response);
  }

  return responseArr;
}
```

This method is useful when you have an item's ID and want to find similar items in the collection by comparing vectors.

## Step 5: Compute Distance Between Items

If you need to compute the similarity between two items in the collection, you can use the `computeDistance` function. It calculates the distance between the vector embeddings of two items, with smaller distances indicating higher similarity.

```ts
export function computeDistanceBetweenProducts(
  key1: string,
  key2: string,
): f64 {
  return collections.computeDistance("myProducts", "searchMethod1", key1, key2)
    .distance;
}
```

## Step 6: Recomputing Search Indexes

Sometimes, you may need to recompute the embeddings for all items in the collection for a specific search method. This can be useful if you change the underlying embedding model.

```ts
export function recomputeIndexes(): Map<string, string> {
  const responseArr: Map<string, string> = new Map<string, string>();
  const searchMethods = ["searchMethod1", "searchMethod2"];

  for (let i = 0; i < searchMethods.length; i++) {
    const response = collections.recomputeSearchMethod(
      "myProducts",
      searchMethods[i],
    );
    if (!response.isSuccessful) {
      responseArr.set(searchMethods[i], response.error);
    }
    responseArr.set(searchMethods[i], response.status);
  }

  return responseArr;
}
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can implement both natural language and vector-based search functionality using the Hypermode Collections API. This allows for flexible search implementations, making it possible to store, retrieve, and search items based on text similarity or vector embeddings.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have configured your project to use Modus by adding the required dependencies to your `hypermode.json` manifest file.

### Add Data to the Collection

Before you can search, you need to add product descriptions to the collection. The sample provides two methods:

- **Single Product Addition**:

  ```typescript
  export function addProduct(description: string): string[] {
    const response = collections.upsert(myProducts, null, description);
    return response.keys;
  }
  ```

  This method adds a single product to the collection. The `upsert` method is used to insert a new product description.

- **Multiple Products Addition**:
  ```typescript
  export function addProducts(descriptions: string[]): string[] {
    const response = collections.upsertBatch(myProducts, [], descriptions);
    return response.keys;
  }
  ```
  Use this method to add multiple product descriptions in a batch.

### Search Using Product Descriptions

The `searchProducts` function allows you to perform a natural language search within the product collection using predefined search methods.

#### Example:

```typescript
export function searchProducts(
  product: string,
  maxItems: i32,
): collections.CollectionSearchResult[] {
  const responseArr: collections.CollectionSearchResult[] = [];
  for (let i: i32 = 0; i < searchMethods.length; i++) {
    const response = collections.search(
      myProducts,
      searchMethods[i],
      product,
      maxItems,
      true,
    );
    responseArr.push(response);
  }
  return responseArr;
}
```

Here’s how it works:

- **Input**: A string (`product`) that describes the product you are searching for.
- **Search Method**: The code iterates through each search method in `searchMethods` to perform the search.
- **Result**: The results are returned in the form of an array of `CollectionSearchResult` objects, each corresponding to a search method.

#### Parameters:

- `product`: The search term (description of the product).
- `maxItems`: The maximum number of items you want to retrieve.

#### Example Usage:

```typescript
const searchResults = searchProducts("laptop", 10);
```

This would search the `myProducts` collection for products related to "laptop" and return up to 10 results.

### 4. **Search Using Vector Embeddings**

In cases where you want to search using vector similarity (for example, comparing two products based on their descriptions), you can use the `searchProductsById` method.

#### Example:

```typescript
export function searchProductsById(
  productId: string,
  maxItems: i32,
): collections.CollectionSearchResult[] {
  const responseArr: collections.CollectionSearchResult[] = [];
  for (let i: i32 = 0; i < searchMethods.length; i++) {
    const vec = collections.getVector(myProducts, searchMethods[i], productId);
    const response = collections.searchByVector(
      myProducts,
      searchMethods[i],
      vec,
      maxItems,
      true,
    );
    responseArr.push(response);
  }
  return responseArr;
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **Input**: The product ID (`productId`) that you want to use as the basis for the search.
- **Search Method**: This method retrieves the vector embedding of the product and uses that vector for similarity search.
- **Result**: The result is an array of `CollectionSearchResult` objects, one for each search method.

#### Example Usage:

```typescript
const searchResultsById = searchProductsById("product123", 5);
```

This searches for the top 5 products that are most similar to `product123` based on their vector embeddings.

### 5. **Recomputing Search Indexes**

If you update or modify the collection frequently, you may need to recompute the search indexes. This ensures that your search methods remain accurate.

#### Example:

```typescript
export function recomputeIndexes(): Map<string, string> {
  const responseArr: Map<string, string> = new Map<string, string>();
  for (let i: i32 = 0; i < searchMethods.length; i++) {
    const response = collections.recomputeSearchMethod(
      myProducts,
      searchMethods[i],
    );
    if (!response.isSuccessful) {
      responseArr.set(searchMethods[i], response.error);
    }
    responseArr.set(searchMethods[i], response.status);
  }
  return responseArr;
}
```

#### Example Usage:

```typescript
const recomputeResponse = recomputeIndexes();
```

This function will recalculate the embeddings and search indexes for all products in the `myProducts` collection.

### Conclusion

This guide explains how to implement search using Hypermode’s collection API, whether you're performing natural language-based or vector similarity searches. By following these steps, you can build a robust search functionality for any collection of text data, such as product descriptions, using the power of vector embeddings and search methods.
