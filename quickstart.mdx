In this quickstart we'll show you how to get set up with Hypermode and build an
intelligent API that you can integrate into your app. You'll learn how to use
the basic components of a Modus app and how to deploy it to Hypermode.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) - v22 or higher
- Text editor - we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Terminal - access Modus through a command-line interface (CLI)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)

## Deploying your first Hypermode project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Modus app">
    We built Hypermode on top of Modus, an open source, serverless framework for crafting
    intelligent functions and APIs, powered by WebAssembly. With Hypermode, you can deploy,
    secure, and observe your Modus apps.

    To get started, [create your first Modus app](/modus/quickstart). You can import this app into
    Hypermode in the next step.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Modus app">
    You can import your Modus app via the Hypermode Console or through the terminal with Hyp CLI.
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Hypermode Console">
        Navigate to the [Hypermode Console](https://hypermode.com/go) and click **New Project**.
        When prompted, connect your GitHub account and select the repository you want to import.
        Once you've selected your repository, click "Import" to deploy your app.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Hyp CLI">
        Install the Hyp CLI via npm.

        ```bash
        npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli
        ```

        From the terminal, run the following command to import your Modus app into Hypermode. This command
        will create your Hypermode project and deploy your app.

        ```bash
        hyp link
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    When Hypermode creates your project, a runtime is initiated for your app as well as connections to
    any [Hypermode-hosted models](/hosted-models).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore API endpoint">
    After deploying your app, Hypermode lands you in your project home. You can see the status of your
    project and the API endpoint generated for your app.

    From the **Query** page, you can run a sample query to verify it's working as expected. In the following
    query, we're going to use the `generateText` function to generate text from the shared Meta Llama
    3.1 model based on the prompt "How are black holes created?"

    ```GraphQL
    query myPrompt {
      generateText(text:"How are black holes created?")
    }
    ```

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/hyp-quickstart/graphiql-blackhole.png"
  alt="Hypermode's console showing results of query 'how are black holes created'."
/>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Observe function execution">
    Let's dig deeper into the behavior of our AI service when we ran the query by looking at the
    **Inferences** page. You can see the step-by-step inference process and the inputs and outputs of
    the model at each step of your function.
    After invoking the Meta Llama model from the function code, we can see the function execution. In this case, it took Llama 4.4 seconds to
    reply to the prompt. We can also see the parameters on both the inputs and outputs.

    ```json
    {
      "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Limit your answers to 150 words."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "How are black holes created?"
        }
      ],
      "max_tokens": 200,
      "temperature": 0.7
    }
    ```

    <img
      className="block"
      src="/images/hyp-quickstart/inference-history.png"
      alt="Hypermode's console showing the inputs and outputs of the last model inference."
    />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize your function">
    Hypermode makes it simple to iterate quickly. Let's make a few changes to your app
    to explore how easy customizing your API is.

    Our API is responding using language that is more formal than we want. Let's update our
    `generateText` function to respond using exclusively surfing analogies.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Go">
      Go to the `main.go` file and locate the `generateText` function. Modify the function to only respond like a surfer, like this:

      ```ts main.go
      func GenerateText(text string) (string, error) {
        model, err := models.GetModel[openai.ChatModel]("text-generator")
        if err != nil {
            return "", err
        }

        input, err := model.CreateInput(
            openai.NewSystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant. Only respond using surfing analogies and metaphors."),
            openai.NewUserMessage(text),
        )
        if err != nil {
            return "", err
        }

        output, err := model.Invoke(input)
        if err != nil {
            return "", err
        }

        return strings.TrimSpace(output.Choices[0].Message.Content), nil
      }
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="AssemblyScript">
      Go to the `index.ts` file and locate the `generateText` function. Modify the function to only respond like a surfer, like this:

      ```ts AssemblyScript
      export function generateText(text: string): string {
        const model = models.getModel<OpenAIChatModel>("text-generator")

        const input = model.createInput([
          new SystemMessage(
            "You are a helpful assistant. Only respond using surfing analogies and metaphors.",
          ),
          new UserMessage(text),
        ])

        const output = model.invoke(input)

        return output.choices[0].message.content.trim()
      }
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Save the file and push an update to your Git repo. Hypermode automatically redeploys
    whenever you push an update to the target branch in your Git repo. Go back to the Hypermode Console
    and run the same query as before. You should see the response now uses surfing analogies!

      <img
        className="block"
        src="/images/hyp-quickstart/graphiql-surfing.png"
        alt="Hypermode's console showing results of new query."
      />

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

Hypermode and Modus provide a powerful platform for building and hosting AI
models, data, and logic. You now know the basics of Hypermode. There's no limit
to what you can build.

And when you're ready to [integrate Hypermode into your app](/integrate-api),
that's as simple as calling a GraphQL endpoint.
