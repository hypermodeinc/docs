Hyp CLI is a command-line tool for managing your Hypermode account and apps.
When using Hyp CLI alongside the Modus CLI, your apps automatically connect to
Hypermode's [Model Router](/model-router) when working locally.

## Install

Install Hyp CLI via npm.

```sh
npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli
```

## Commands

### `login`

Log in to your Hypermode account. When executed, this command redirects to the
Hypermode console to authenticate. It stores an authentication token locally and
prompts you to select your organization context.

### `logout`

Log out of your Hypermode account. This command clears your local authentication
token.

### `link`

Link your GitHub repo to a Hypermode project. The command adds a default GitHub
Actions workflow to build your Modus app and a Hypermode GitHub app for
auto-deployment on commit.

### `org switch`

Switch to a different org context within the CLI session.
