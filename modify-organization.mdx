Within an organization, you can modify the name and slug to align with your naming conventions and organizational structure.

### Steps to Modify an Existing Organization

1. **Navigate to the Organization Settings**  
   To modify an organization, navigate to the top-level navigation bar and select the organization you want to update. Once you are in the organization’s scope, go to the **Settings** tab in the horizontal navigation.

2. **Edit Organization Settings**  
   In the **Organization Settings** section, you can:

   - **Change the Organization Name**: Update the organization’s name as needed to reflect your current organizational structure or naming conventions.
   - **Update the Organization Slug**: Modify the organization slug if required.

     - **Slug Requirements**: Organization slugs must be 25 characters or less and can only contain letters and numbers. They must not start or end with a dash (`-`).

     > **Note**: Changing the organization or project slug will also update the GraphQL endpoints for all associated projects. Ensure that any clients or integrations using the old endpoints are updated accordingly.

### Saving Changes

After making any modifications, click the **Save** button to apply your updates. Keep in mind that updating the organization slug may temporarily disrupt service availability until the updates are fully applied.

<Warning>

If you update the organization slug, any existing integrations that use the old GraphQL
endpoint must be reconfigured to point to the new endpoint. Make sure to communicate
these changes with your team or stakeholders.

</Warning>

### Deleting a Organization

If you no longer need an organization, you can delete it permanently. To delete an organization, all projects must be deleted first.

To delete an organization, go to the top-level navigation bar and select the organization you want to delete. Navigate to the organization's **Settings** tab located in the horizontal navigation.

Within **Settings** click on the **Delete** section. Click on the **Delete** button and enter the organization's name as confirmation. This action is irreversible and will permanently delete your organization.
