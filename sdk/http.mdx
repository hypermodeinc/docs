The HTTP API allows you to securely call and fetch data from an HTTP endpoint.

<Tip>
  We're constantly introducing new APIs through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

## fetch

Invoke an HTTP endpoint to retrieve data or trigger external action.

```ts AssemblyScript
fetch (
  request: Request,
): Response
```

<ResponseField name="request" type="Request" required>
  A [Request](#request-object) object for calling an HTTP endpoint.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="response" type="Response">
  A [Response](#response-object) object from the HTTP endpoint.
</ResponseField>

## Request object

<ResponseField name="url" type="string">
  The URL to send the request to. You must have a corresponding
  [Host](/define-hosts) in your project's manifest.

Example: https://example.com/whatever

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="method" type="string">
  The HTTP method to use for the request.

Example: "GET"

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="headers" type="Headers">
  The HTTP headers for the request, as [defined in your
  manifest](../define-hosts).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="body" type="ArrayBuffer">
  The raw HTTP request body, as an `ArrayBuffer`.
</ResponseField>

## Response object

<ResponseField name="status" type="u16">
  The HTTP response status code.

Example: 200

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="statusText" type="string">
  The HTTP response status text.

Example: "OK"

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="headers" type="Headers">
  The HTTP response headers.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="body" type="ArrayBuffer">
  The raw HTTP response body, as an `ArrayBuffer`.

  <Tip>
    The response body isn't normally read directly. Instead, use `response.text()` or `response.json<T>()` functions.
  </Tip>
</ResponseField>
