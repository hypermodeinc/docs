Hypermode's HTTP API allows you to securely call and fetch data from an HTTP endpoint.
It's similar to the HTTP [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API used in JavaScript,
but with some modifications to work with Hypermode Functions.

<Note>

As a security measure, you can only call HTTP endpoints that you've [defined in your project's manifest](../define-hosts).
Any attempt to access an arbitrary URL, for a host not defined in your project's manifest, results in an error.

Additionally, you should use placeholders for host secrets in the manifest, rather than hardcoding them in your functions.
Enter the values for each hosts' secrets via the Hypermode UI. This ensures that your secrets are securely stored, aren't
committed to your repository, and aren't visible or accessible from your functions code.

</Note>

## Example project

For your reference, A complete example for using the HTTP API is available on GitHub in the
`hypermodeAI/functions-as` repository, at [/examples/http](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/functions-as/tree/main/examples/http).

## Import from the SDK

To begin, import the `http` namespace from the SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
import { http } from "@hypermode/functions-as";
```

</CodeGroup>

## HTTP APIs

The APIs in the `http` namespace are below, organized by category.

<Tip>
  We're constantly introducing new APIs through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### Functions

#### fetch

Invoke an HTTP endpoint to retrieve data or trigger external action.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
http.fetch(
  requestOrUrl: string | Request,
  options: RequestOptions = new RequestOptions(),
): Response
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="requestOrUrl" type="string | Request" required>

Either a URL `string` or a [`Request`](#request) object, describing the HTTP request to make.

If a `string`, the operation uses the `GET` HTTP method with no headers other than
those defined in the manifest entry of the host.

<Note>
  Each request must match to a host entry in the manifest, using the `baseUrl`
  field. The request URL passed to the `fetch` function (or via a `Request`
  object) must start with the manifest entry's `baseUrl` value to match.
</Note>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="response" type="Response">
  A [Response](#response-object) object from the HTTP endpoint.
</ResponseField>

### Objects

#### Request

<ResponseField name="url" type="string">
  The URL to send the request to. You must have a corresponding
  [Host](/define-hosts) in your project's manifest.

Example: https://example.com/whatever

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="method" type="string">
  The HTTP method to use for the request.

Example: "GET"

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="headers" type="Headers">
  The HTTP headers for the request, as [defined in your
  manifest](../define-hosts).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="body" type="ArrayBuffer">
  The raw HTTP request body, as an `ArrayBuffer`.
</ResponseField>

#### Response object

<ResponseField name="status" type="u16">
  The HTTP response status code.

Example: 200

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="statusText" type="string">
  The HTTP response status text.

Example: "OK"

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="headers" type="Headers">
  The HTTP response headers.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="body" type="ArrayBuffer">
  The raw HTTP response body, as an `ArrayBuffer`.

  <Tip>
    The response body isn't normally read directly. Instead, use `response.text()` or `response.json<T>()` functions.
  </Tip>
</ResponseField>
