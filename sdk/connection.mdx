Connection APIs allow you to securely access an API endpoint at a defined host.

<Tip>We're introducing new APIs consistently through ongoing development with build partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!</Tip>

### invokeGraphqlApi
Make a query or mutation against a GraphQL API endpoint.

```TypeScript
invokeGraphqlApi (
    hostName: string,
    query: string,
    variables?: Map<string, string>
):
```

<ResponseField name="hostName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your host, as [defined in your manifest](../define-hosts).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="query" type="string" required>
  GraphQL operation for execution on your API server to retrieve or write data.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="variables" type="string">
  Optional variables added to the query.
</ResponseField>
