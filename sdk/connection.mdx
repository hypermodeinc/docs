Connection APIs allow you to securely access an API endpoint at a defined host.

<Tip>
  We're introducing new APIs consistently through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### invokeGraphqlApi
