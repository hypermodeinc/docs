Connection APIs allow you to securely access an API endpoint at a defined host.

<Tip>
  We're introducing new APIs consistently through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### invokeGraphqlApi

Make a query or mutation against a GraphQL API endpoint.

```ts
invokeGraphqlApi<TData> (
  hostName: string,
  statement: string,
  variables?: QueryVariables
): GQLResponse<TData>
```

<ResponseField name="TData" type="Type" required>
  Type of object to use for the data returned from the query.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="hostName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your host, as [defined in your manifest](../define-hosts).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>
  GraphQL operation for execution on your API server to retrieve or write data.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="variables" type="QueryVariables">
  Optional variables added to the query.

Example:

```ts
const vars = new QueryVariables();
vars.set("firstName", firstName);
vars.set("lastName", lastName);
```

</ResponseField>

### GQLResponse object

A response object from the GraphQL query.

<ResponseField name="data" type="TData">
  The results of the GraphQL operation.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="errors" type="GQLError[]">
  Any errors incurred as part of your GraphQL request.
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="message" type="string">
      Description of the error incurred.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="path" type="string[]">
      Query path of the error incurred. Each item in the array represents a
      segment of the path.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="locations" type="GQLErrorLocation[]">
      <Expandable title="properties">
        <ResponseField name="line" type="u32">
          Specific line number of the request that points to the error.
        </ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="column" type="u32">
          Specific column number of the request that points to the error.
        </ResponseField>
      </Expandable>
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>
