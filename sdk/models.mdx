{/* <!-- vale Google.Headings = NO --> */}

Hypermode's Models API allows you to invoke AI models directly from your functions,
both for models hosted at Hypermode, and for models hosted by external services.

Since many models have unique interfaces, the design of the Models API is extremely
flexible. A common base class forms the core of the API, which extends to conform to
any model's required schema.

A separate library, [`models-as`](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/models-as) contains
both the base classes and pre-defined implementations for many commonly used models.
You can either use one of the pre-defined classes, or can create custom classes for
any model you like, by extending from the base `Model` class.

## Example project

For your reference, several complete examples for using the Models API are available
on GitHub in the `hypermodeAI/functions-as` repository:

- [/examples/classification](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/functions-as/tree/main/examples/classification)
- [/examples/embedding](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/functions-as/tree/main/examples/embedding)
- [/examples/textgeneration](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/functions-as/tree/main/examples/textgeneration)

Each example demonstrates using different types of AI models for different purposes.
However, the Models interface isn't limited to these purposes. You can use it for any
task that an AI model can perform.

<Note>
  Currently, the models interface doesn't support streaming data, either for
  input or output. For example, you can't use it with models that process
  streaming audio or video, nor provide streaming text output. We plan to
  address this limitation in a future release.

## Import from the SDK

To begin, import the `models` namespace from the SDK.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
import { models } from "@hypermode/functions-as";
```

</CodeGroup>

You'll also need to import one or more classes for the model you are working with.

For example:

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
import { ClassificationModel } from "@hypermode/models-as/models/experimental/classification";
```

Refer to the [`hypermodeAI/models-as`](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/models-as/tree/main/src/models)
repository for the full list of available models. We're constantly adding new models, so the
list may have grown since you last checked.

If you would like to request a new model, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/models-as/issues)
on the `models-as` repository. You can also send a pull request, if you'd like to contribute a new model yourself.

</CodeGroup>

## Models APIs

The APIs in the `models` namespace are below, organized by category.

<Tip>
  We're constantly introducing new APIs through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### Functions

#### getModel

Get a model instance by name.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
models.getModel<T>(modelName: string): T
```

</CodeGroup>
