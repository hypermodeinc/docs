Hypermode's GraphQL APIs allows you to securely call and fetch data from any GraphQL endpoint.
After [defining a host](../define-hosts) for the GraphQL endpoint in your project's manifest,
you can use the following APIs to interact with the data.

## Example project

For your reference, A complete example for using the GraphQL APIs is available on GitHub in the
`hypermodeAI/functions-as` repository, at [/examples/graphql](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/functions-as/tree/main/examples/graphql).

## Import from the SDK

To begin, import the `graphql` namespace from the SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
import { graphql } from "@hypermode/functions-as";
```

</CodeGroup>

## GraphQL APIs

The APIs in the `graphql` namespace are below, organized by category.

<Tip>
  We're constantly introducing new APIs through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### Functions

#### execute

Execute a GraphQL statement to call a query or apply mutation against a GraphQL API endpoint.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
graphql.execute<TData> (
  hostName: string,
  statement: string,
  variables?: Variables
): Response<TData>
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="TData" type="Type" required>
  Type of object to use for the data returned from the query.
  This can be any type, including a custom type defined in your project.
  It should match the shape of the data returned from the GraphQL query.

<Tip>

Define custom types in the project's source code.
In AssemblyScript, create classes decorated with `@json`.

All types, including classes, base classes, and field types must be JSON serializable.
You can also use built-in types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and maps.

</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="hostName" type="string" required>
  Name of the host, as [defined in the manifest](../define-hosts).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statement" type="string" required>
  GraphQL statement containing the query or mutation operation to execute.

<Warning>
  While it's possible to directly include parameter values into your GraphQL
  statement, it's highly recommended to pass a [`Variables`](#variables) object
  instead. This can help to prevent against injection attacks and other security
  vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="variables" type="Variables">

Optional variables to include with the query.

See the details of the [`Variables`](#variables) object for more information.

</ResponseField>

### Objects

#### Variables

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
class Variables {
  public set<T>(name: string, value: T): void;
  public toJSON(): string;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

A container for variables to include with a GraphQL operation.

To use this feature, create a new `Variables` object and call the `set` method
for each variable you want to include. Then pass the object to the `execute` function.

<ResponseField name="set(name, value)">

Set a variable with a name and value to include with the GraphQL operation.

<Accordion title="Parameters">

<ResponseField name="T">

The type of the value to include with the GraphQL operation.

You don't usually need to specify this type explicitly, as the compiler can infer it from the value you pass.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the variable to include in the GraphQL operation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="value" type="T" required>

The value of the variable to include in the GraphQL operation.

The value can be of any type that's JSON serializable, including strings, numbers,
boolean values, arrays, maps, and custom objects decorated with `@json`.

</ResponseField>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example">

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
const vars = new graphql.Variables();
vars.set("firstName", firstName);
vars.set("lastName", lastName);

const response = graphql.execute<PeopleData>(hostName, statement, vars);
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="toJSON()" type="string">

Serializes the variables to a JSON string for inclusion in the GraphQL
operation. The `execute` function calls this automatically when you pass a
`Variables` object. You typically don't need to call it directly.

</ResponseField>

#### Response

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
class Response<T> {
  errors: ErrorResult[] | null;
  data: T | null;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

A response object from the GraphQL query.

Either `errors` or `data` is present, depending on the result of the query.

<ResponseField name="errors" type="ErrorResult[]">

An array of errors incurred as part of your GraphQL request, if any.

Each error in the array is an [`ErrorResult`](#errorresult) object.
If there are no errors, this field is `null`.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="T">

The resulting data selected by the GraphQL operation.

The data has the type specified in the call to the `execute` function.
If data is absent due to errors, this field is `null`.

</ResponseField>

#### ErrorResult

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
class ErrorResult {
  message: string;
  locations: CodeLocation[] | null;
  path: string[] | null;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

The details of an error incurred as part of a GraphQL operation.

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  Description of the error incurred.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="path" type="string[]">

Path to the area of the GraphQL statement related to the error.

Each item in the array represents a segment of the path.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="locations" type="CodeLocation[]">
  An array of [`CodeLocation`](#codelocation) objects that point to the specific
  location of the error in the GraphQL statement.
</ResponseField>

#### CodeLocation

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
class CodeLocation {
  line: u32;
  column: u32;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

The location of specific code within a GraphQL statement.

<ResponseField name="line" type="u32">
  Line number within the GraphQL statement for the code.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="column" type="u32">
  Column number within the GraphQL statement for the code.
</ResponseField>
