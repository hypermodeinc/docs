Console APIs allow you to interact with the Hypermode Console.

<Tip>
  We're introducing new APIs consistently through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### log

Generate a log message for debugging at runtime.

```ts
log (
  message: string,
  level?: string
)
```

<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
  Contextual information to understand the behavior of the function at runtime.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="level" type="string">
  Severity of log message, one of `info` (default), `error`, `warning` or
  `debug`.
</ResponseField>
