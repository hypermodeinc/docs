The Functions SDK gives your project access to a set of APIs that simplify the development and ongoing iteration of AI-powered features and assistants.

<Note>
  The Functions SDK includes support for AssemblyScript, a portable
  TypeScript-like language. Additional language support is in development.

For inspiration on getting started, reference the [examples in the Function SDK repo](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/functions-as/tree/main/examples).
