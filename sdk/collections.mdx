Hypermode Collections provide a built-in key-value storage mechanism that supports vector
embeddings, that you can use from your functions. After [defining collections](../define-collections)
in your project's manifest, you can use the following APIs to interact with the data.

## Import from the SDK

To begin, import the `collections` namespace from the SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
import { collections } from "@hypermode/functions-as";
```

</CodeGroup>

## Collections APIs

The APIs in the `collections` namespace are below, organized by category.

<Tip>
  We're constantly introducing new APIs through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### Mutation Functions

#### upsert

Inserts or updates an item into a collection.

<Note>
  If an item with the same key already exists, the original text is overwritten
  with the new text.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
collections.upsert(
  collection: string,
  key: string | null,
  text: string,
): CollectionMutationResult
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="collection" type="string" required>
  Name of the collection, as [defined in the manifest](../define-collections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string">
  An optional key for the item. If `null`, Hypermode assigns a new UUID as the
  key for the item.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text" type="string" required>
  The text of the item to add to the collection.
</ResponseField>

#### upsertBatch

Inserts or updates a batch of items into a collection.

<Note>
  If an item with the same key already exists, the original text is overwritten
  with the new text.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
collections.upsertBatch(
  collection: string,
  keys: string[] | null,
  texts: string[],
): CollectionMutationResult
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="collection" type="string" required>
  Name of the collection, as [defined in the manifest](../define-collections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="keys" type="string[]">
  Array of keys for the item to add to the collection. If you pass `null` for
  any key, Hypermode assigns a new UUID as the key for the item.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="texts" type="string[]" required>
  Array of texts for the items to add to the collection.
</ResponseField>

#### remove

Removes an item from the collection.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
collections.remove(
  collection: string,
  key: string,
): CollectionMutationResult
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="collection" type="string" required>
  Name of the collection, as [defined in the manifest](../define-collections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string" required>
  The key of the item to delete from the collection.
</ResponseField>

### Search and Retrieval Functions

#### search

Search for an item in the collection by using natural language search.

<Note>
  Hypermode uses the same embedder for both inserting text into the collection,
  and for the text used when searching the collection.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
collections.search(
  collection: string,
  searchMethod: string,
  text: string,
  limit: i32,
  returnText: bool = false,
): CollectionSearchResult
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="collection" type="string" required>
  Name of the collection, as [defined in the manifest](../define-collections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="searchMethod" type="string" required>
  The search method used to calculate embedding for text & search against.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text" type="string" required>
  The text to compute natural language search on.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="limit" type="i32" required>
  The number of result objects to return.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="returnText" type="bool">
  A flag to return the texts in the response.
</ResponseField>

#### computeSimilarity

Computes similarity between two keys in a collection using a search method's embedder.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
collections.computeSimilarity(
  collection: string,
  searchMethod: string,
  key1: string,
  key2: string,
): CollectionSearchResultObject
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="collection" type="string" required>
  Name of the collection, as [defined in the manifest](../define-collections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="searchMethod" type="string" required>
  The search method used to calculate embedding for key's texts.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key1, key2" type="string" required>
  Keys to compute similarity on.
</ResponseField>

#### getText

Gets an item's text from a collection, give the item's key.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
collections.getText(collection: string, key: string): string
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="collection" type="string" required>
  Name of the collection, as [defined in the manifest](../define-collections).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string" required>
  The key of the item to retrieve.
</ResponseField>

#### getTexts

Get all items from a collection.
The result is a map of key to text for all items in the collection.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
collections.getTexts(collection: string): Map<string, string>
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="collection" type="string" required>
  Name of the collection, as [defined in the manifest](../define-collections).
</ResponseField>

### Maintenance Functions

#### recomputeSearchMethod

Recomputes the embeddings for all texts in a collection, for a specific search method.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AssemblyScript
collections.recomputeSearchMethod(
  collection: string,
  searchMethod: string,
): collections.SearchMethodMutationResult
```

</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="collection" type="string" required>
  Name of the collection, as [defined in the manifest](../define-collections).
</ResponseField>
