Inference APIs allow you to invoke AI models defined in your project's [manifest](../manifest) with less scaffolding.

<Tip>
  We're introducing new APIs consistently through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### generateText

Invoke a generative AI model with an instruction and prompt, resulting in a text response.

```TypeScript
generateText (
  modelName: string,
  instruction: string,
  prompt: string
): string
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="instruction" type="string" required>
  High-level instruction for the processing of the given prompt.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="prompt" type="string" required>
  Queries for response within the context of the given instruction.
</ResponseField>

### computeClassificationLabels

Invoke a fine-tuned classification model with a text input, resulting in an array of labels and probabilities.

```TypeScript
computeClassificationLabels (
  modelName: string,
  text: string
): Map<string, number>
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text" type="string" required>
  Text input for classification amongst labels defined in the fine-tuning
  process.
</ResponseField>

### embedText

Invoke an embedding model with a text input, resulting in a vector embedding.

```TypeScript
embedText (
  modelName: string,
  text: string,
): number
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text" type="string" required>
  Text input for embedding.
</ResponseField>
