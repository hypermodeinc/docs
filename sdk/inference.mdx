Inference APIs allow you to invoke AI models defined in your project's [manifest](../manifest) with less scaffolding.

<Tip>
  We're introducing new APIs consistently through ongoing development with build
  partners. [Let's chat](mailto:help@hypermode.com) about what would make the
  Functions SDK even more powerful for your next use case!
</Tip>

### generateText

Invoke a generative AI model with an instruction and prompt, resulting in a text response.

```ts
generateText (
  modelName: string,
  instruction: string,
  prompt: string
): string
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="instruction" type="string" required>
  High-level instruction for the processing of the given prompt.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="prompt" type="string" required>
  Queries for response within the context of the given instruction.
</ResponseField>

### classifyText

Invoke a fine-tuned classification model with a text input, resulting in a single classification label that exceeds the provided threshold.

```ts
classifyText (
  modelName: string,
  text: string,
  threshold: f32
): string
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text" type="string" required>
  Text input for classification amongst labels defined in the fine-tuning
  process.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="threshold" type="f32" required>
  Confidence factor for classification. If no labels exist with a probability
  higher than this threshold, the model won't produce a result.
</ResponseField>

### getClassificationLabelsForText

Invoke a fine-tuned classification model with a text input, resulting in an array of labels and probabilities.

```ts
getClassificationLabelsForText (
  modelName: string,
  text: string
): Map<string, f32>
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text" type="string" required>
  Text input for classification amongst labels defined in the fine-tuning
  process.
</ResponseField>

### getClassificationLabelsForTexts

Invoke a fine-tuned classification model with multiple text inputs, resulting in an array of an array of labels and probabilities.

```ts
getClassificationLabelsForTexts (
  modelName: string,
  texts: Map<string, string>
): Map<string, Map<string, f32>>
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="texts" type="Map<string, string>" required>
  Text inputs for classification amongst labels defined in the fine-tuning
  process.
</ResponseField>

### getClassificationProbability

Invoke a fine-tuned classification model with a text input, resulting in the probability of the provided label.

```ts
getClassificationProbability (
  modelName: string,
  text: string,
  label: string
): f32
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text" type="string" required>
  Text input for classification based on the label provided.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="label" type="string" required>
  The label to classify the provided text against.
</ResponseField>

### getTextEmbedding

Invoke an embedding model with a text input, resulting in a vector embedding.

```ts
getTextEmbedding (
  modelName: string,
  text: string
): f64[]
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text" type="string" required>
  Text input for embedding.
</ResponseField>

### getTextEmbeddings

Invoke an embedding model with multiple text inputs, resulting in an array of vector embeddings.

```ts
getTextEmbeddings (
  modelName: string,
  texts: Map<string, string>
): Map<string, f64[]>
```

<ResponseField name="modelName" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model, as [defined in your manifest](../define-models).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="texts" type="Map<string, string>" required>
  Text inputs for embedding.
</ResponseField>
