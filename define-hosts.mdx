title: Define Hosts
description: "Securely connect to your data"

## Overview

Hosts establish connectivity to external services. They're used for HTTP and GraphQL APIs,
database connections, and externally hosted AI models. The `hosts` object in the
[project manifest](/manifest) allows you to define these hosts, for secure access from within a function.

Each host requires a unique name, specified as a key containing only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

Each host has a `type` property, which controls how it's used and which additional properties are available.
If not provided, the default type is `http`. The following table lists the available host types:

| Type         | Purpose                                | Functions Namespaces        |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `http`       | Connect to an HTTP or HTTPS web server | `http`, `graphql`, `models` |
| `postgresql` | Connect to a PostgreSQL database       | `postgresql`                |
| `dgraph`     | Connect to a DGraph database           | `dgraph`                    |

We'll update this table as we add more host types.

<Warning>
### Caution

Don't include secrets directly in the manifest!

If your host requires authentication, you can include _placeholders_ in host properties
which resolve to their respective secrets at runtime. Set the actual secrets via the
Hypermode Console, where they're securely stored until needed.

## HTTP Host

This host type supports the HTTP and HTTPS protocols to communicate with external hosts.
You can use the [HTTP APIs](/sdk/http) in the Functions SDK to interact with the host.

This host type is also used for [GraphQL APIs](/sdk/graphql) and to invoke externally hosted AI [models](/sdk/models).

**Example:**

```json hypermode.json
{
  "hosts": {
    "openai": {
      "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
  Always set to `"http"` for this host type. This is the default if not
  specified.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="baseUrl" type="string" required>
  Base URL for connections to the host.
  - Must end with a trailing slash.
  - May contain path segments if necessary.

Example: `"https://api.example.com/v1/"`

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endpoint" type="string" required>
  Full URL endpoint for connections to the host.

Example: `"https://models.example.com/v1/classifier"`

</ResponseField>

<Note>
  You must include either a `baseUrl` or an `endpoint`, but not both.
  - Use `baseUrl` for connections to a host with a common base URL.
  - Use `endpoint` for connections to a specific URL.

Typically, you'll use the `baseUrl` field. However, some APIs, such as `graphql.execute`,
require the full URL in the `endpoint` field.

</Note>

<ResponseField name="headers" type="object">
  If provided, requests to the host include these headers. Each key-value pair is a header name and value.

Values may include variables using the `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax, which resolve at runtime to secrets
provided for each host, via the Hypermode Console.

  <Accordion title="Examples">

This example specifies a header named `Authorization` that uses the `Bearer` scheme. A secret named `AUTH_TOKEN` provides the token:

```json
"headers": {
  "Authorization": "Bearer {{AUTH_TOKEN}}"
}
```

This example specifies a header named `X-API-Key` provided by a secret named `API_KEY`:

```json
"headers": {
  "X-API-Key": "{{API_KEY}}"
}
```

You can use a special syntax for hosts that require [HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
In this example, secrets named `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` combined and then are base64-encoded to form a compliant `Authorization` header value:

```json
"headers": {
  "Authorization": "Basic {{base64(USERNAME:PASSWORD)}}"
}
```

  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="queryParameters" type="object">
  If provided, requests to the host include these query parameters, appended to the URL. Each key-value pair is a parameter name and value.

Values may include variables using the `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax, which resolve at runtime to secrets provided for each host, via the Hypermode Console.

  <Accordion title="Example">

This example specifies a query parameter named `key` provided by a secret named `API_KEY`:

```json
"queryParameters": {
  "key": "{{API_KEY}}"
}
```

  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

## PostgreSQL Host

This host type supports connecting to PostgreSQL databases.
You can use the [PostgreSQL APIs](/sdk/postgresql) in the Functions SDK to interact with the database.

**Example:**

```json hypermode.json
{
  "hosts": {
    "my-database": {
      "type": "postgresql",
      "connString": "postgresql://{{PG_USER}}:{{PG_PASSWORD}}@db.example.com:5432/data?sslmode=require"
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  Always set to `"postgresql"` for this host type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connString" type="string" required>
  The connection string for the PostgreSQL database.

Values may include variables using the `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax, which resolve at runtime to secrets
provided for each host, via the Hypermode Console.

The connection string in the preceding example includes:

- A username and password provided by secrets named `PG_USER` & `PG_PASSWORD`
- A host named `db.example.com` on port `5432`
- A database named `data`
- SSL mode set to `require` - which is highly recommended for secure connections

Refer to [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) for more details on connection strings.

<Tip>

Managed PostgreSQL providers often provide a pre-made connection string for you to copy. Check your provider's documentation for details.

For example, if using Neon, refer to the [Neon documentation](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

</Tip>

</ResponseField>

## DGraph Host

This host type supports connecting to DGraph databases.
You can use the [DGraph APIs](/sdk/dgraph) in the Functions SDK to interact with the database.

**Example:**

```json hypermode.json
{
  "hosts": {
    "my-dgraph": {
      "type": "dgraph",
      "grpcTarget": "frozen-mango.grpc.eu-central-1.aws.cloud.dgraph.io:443",
      "key": "{{DGRAPH_API_KEY}}"
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  Always set to `"dgraph"` for this host type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="grpcTarget" type="string" required>
  The gRPC target for the DGraph database.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string" required>
  The API key for the DGraph database.
</ResponseField>
