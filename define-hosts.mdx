Hosts establish connectivity for models and other external endpoints. The [project manifest](/manifest) allows you to define hosts for secure access from within a function.

```hypermode.json
{
  "hosts": [
    {
        "name": "openai"
        "endpoint": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Properties

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your host. Used for indicating the host of a model or for a connection.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endpoint" type="string" required>
  ...
</ResponseField>
