## Connection strings

A connection string is a URL that contains all of the necessary information to
connect to your graph from a Dgraph client or Modus. It is displayed after you
deploy your graph.

## Authentication

Your graph endpoint is protected by bearer token authorization passed in the
`Authorization` header as an API key. You can find your API key in the console
alongside your graph connection details. The API key is already included in the
connection string.

<Warning>
  If you remove your API key from your graph, it is made publicly accessible
  with no authentication.
</Warning>

## Clients

Dgraph includes a web client and language-specific SDKs for programmatically
working with your graph. When using the auto-generated GraphQL API, you can use
any GraphQL client to work with your graph.

### Ratel

Dgraph includes Ratel, a web client for easily connecting to and exploring your
graph. Ratel is available hosted at https://ratel.hypermode.com. To connect to
your graph, paste your connection string into the Ratel interface and click
`Connect`.

### Dgraph SDKs

Dgraph SDKs are available for a number of languages, including
[Go](/dgraph/sdks/go), [Python](/dgraph/sdks/python), [Java](/dgraph/sdks/java),
and [JavaScript](/dgraph/sdks/javascript). The SDKs have been updated to support
the connection string for connecting to your graph on Hypermode. Ensure you're
running the latest version of the SDK for your language.

### GraphQL clients

When working with your graph through the auto-generated GraphQL API, you can use
any [GraphQL IDE or client](/dgraph/graphql/connecting) to connect to your
graph.

### Modus

Modus provides a framework for integrating data from your graph into a complete
AI-ready backend. Learn more on
[connecting Modus to your graph](/modus/data-fetching#dgraph).
