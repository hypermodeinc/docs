Querying (reading) and mutating (writing) data to your graph is simple using an
[IDE or SDK](./connect). For bulk operations, there are tools for importing,
exporting, and dropping data.

## Import data

Dgraph provides multiple tools for importing data to your graph, whether an
[initial import to an empty graph](/dgraph/admin/bulk-loader) or an
[incremental import](/dgraph/admin/live-loader).

You can also [load CSV-formatted data](/dgraph/admin/import-csv).

## Export data

If you need to export data from your graph, please reach out to support and we
can assist.

<Note>Self-service for exporting data is coming soon.</Note>

## Drop data

Dropping data from your graph is a permanent action and can't be undone. To drop
data from your graph, you can use the `/alter` endpoint.

To drop all data from your graph, while maintaining the schema:

```sh
curl -X POST https://<my-database>.hypermode.host/dgraph/alter \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json"  \
    --data '{"drop_op": "DATA"}'
```

For more options, see [Dgraph's documentation](/dgraph/admin/drop-data).
