  Graphs on Hypermode is currently in developer preview. New features are
  shipping weekly.
</Info>

Graphs on Hypermode provides a fully managed [Dgraph](/dgraph) service for
building and deploying knowledge graphs. This service combines the power of
Dgraph's distributed graph database with Hypermode's AI development platform,
offering a seamless experience for developers and organizations of all sizes.

## Key features

| [Scale to Zero](./manage-graph#scale-to-zero)             | automatically scale down after periods of inactivity and scale back up on demand |
| [Autoscaling](./manage-graph#autoscaling)                 | dynamic resource allocation based on workload demands                            |
| [Flexible Schema Options](./manage-schema)                | start schema-less or define structured schemas using DQL or GraphQL              |
| [Regional Deployment](./manage-graph#region-availability) | deploy in multiple regions for low-latency access                                |
| [Modus Integration](/modus/data-fetching#dgraph)          | seamlessly integrate with Hypermode's Modus framework for AI-ready backends      |
| [Fully Managed Service](./manage-graph)                   | deploy, scale, and operate your graph database without infrastructure headaches  |

## Getting started

To get started with Graphs on Hypermode:

1. **[Deploy a new graph](./deploy)**: create your graph database
2. **[Connect to your graph](./connect)**: use connection strings to access your
   graph from various clients
3. **[Manage your schema](./manage-schema)**: define your graph structure using
   DQL or GraphQL _(optional)_
4. **[Manage data](./manage-data)**: add, query, and manipulate data in your
   graph

## Use cases

Graphs on Hypermode is ideal for:

- Knowledge graphs for AI apps
- Social networks and recommendation systems
- Fraud detection and pattern recognition
- Content management systems with rich interconnections
- Complex relationship modeling
- Any app requiring efficient traversal of connected data

## Why Graphs on Hypermode?

Traditional data stores struggle with highly connected data and complex
relationship queries, which are often found in knowledge graphs. Graph stores
like Dgraph excel at modeling and querying relationships, making them perfect
for building with AI services, where connections between data points are as
important as the data itself.

Hypermode's managed service eliminates the operational complexity of running
Dgraph, allowing you to focus on building your app while we handle scaling,
backups, and infrastructure management.
