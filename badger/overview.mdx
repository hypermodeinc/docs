## What is Badger? {/* <!-- vale Google.Contractions = NO --> */}

BadgerDB is an embeddable, persistent, and fast key-value (KV) database written
in pure Go. It's the underlying database for [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io), a
fast, distributed graph database. It's meant to be an efficient alternative to
non-Go-based key-value stores like RocksDB.

## Changelog

We keep the
[repo Changelog](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) up
to date with each release.
