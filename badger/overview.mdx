## What is Badger?

BadgerDB is an embeddable, persistent, and fast key-value (KV) database written
in pure Go. It is the underlying database for [Dgraph](/dgraph), a fast,
distributed graph database. It is meant to be an efficient alternative to
non-Go-based key-value stores like RocksDB.

## Changelog

We keep the
[repo Changelog](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/badger/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
up to date with each release.
