description: Architected for fast key-value storage in Go
"og:title": "Design - Badger"
---

We wrote Badger with these design goals in mind:

- Write a key-value database in pure Go
- Use latest research to build the fastest KV database for data sets spanning
  terabytes
- Optimize for modern storage devices

Badgerâ€™s design is based on a paper titled
[WiscKey: Separating Keys from Values in SSD-conscious Storage](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast16/fast16-papers-lu.pdf).

<sup>1</sup> The WiscKey paper (on which Badger is based) saw big wins with
separating values from keys, significantly reducing the write amplification
compared to a typical LSM tree.

<sup>2</sup> RocksDB is an SSD-optimized version of LevelDB, which was designed
specifically for rotating disks. As such RocksDB's design isn't aimed at SSDs.

<sup>3</sup> SSI: Serializable Snapshot Isolation. For more details, see the
blog post [Concurrent ACID Transactions in
Badger](https://dgraph.io/blog/post/badger-txn/)

<sup>4</sup> Badger provides direct access to value versions via its Iterator
API. Users can also specify how many versions to keep per key via Options.

## Benchmarks

We've run comprehensive benchmarks against RocksDB, BoltDB, and LMDB. The
benchmarking code with detailed logs are in the
[badger-bench](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger-bench) repo.
