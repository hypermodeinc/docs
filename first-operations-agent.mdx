  languageâ€”no code required"
sidebarTitle: "Your First Operations Agent"

In this tutorial, you'll build your first AI operations agentâ€”a financial
operations agent that processes payments, manages refunds, and analyzes
financial data using Stripe through natural language commands. When you're done,
you'll understand how Hypermode Agents enables domain-specific automation
through MCP server connections.

_Who is this for?_ Anyone new to Hypermode who wants to quickly build and deploy
an operations-focused AI agent that can handle real financial workflowsâ€”no prior
experience required.

Along the way we'll explore how Hypermode Agents transforms natural language
into powerful financial operations, including the concepts of
[connections](/agents/connections) and [threads](/agents/work), specifically
applied to payment processing and financial data management.

## Prerequisites

- A [Hypermode Pro workspace](https://hypermode.com/login)
- A [Stripe account](https://stripe.com) (test mode is perfect for this
  tutorial)
- Access to your operations tools (for example, internal knowledge base) - we'll
  use Notion for this tutorial
- Basic familiarity with modern chat interfaces (no coding required)
- Estimated time: 15 minutes

## Step 1: Sign in and open your workspace

Head to [hypermode.com](https://hypermode.com), sign in, and create your first
workspace if you haven't already.

## Step 2: Open Hypermode Concierge + Agent builder

In the left sidebar, click the [threads](/agents/work) icon.

Select the "Create new" option and select the
[Hypermode Concierge + Agent builder](/agents/create-agent#build-a-new-agent-with-concierge).
This is Hypermode's AI-powered agent that transforms natural language
descriptions into fully functional agents that can work with specialized tools
like Stripe.

![Create new agent](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/create-new.png)

## Step 3: Describe the job

In plain English, type something like:

```text
Let's build a financial operations agent that can process payments, handle refunds,
create invoices, and analyze financial data using Stripe. It should be able to
work with our internal policies from Notion to make decisions about refunds.
```

Concierge will ask clarifying questions about your specific operations needs,
draft an initial system prompt, and suggest the Stripe connection along with any
other tools you mention.

![Create new agent with Concierge](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/create-new-concierge.png)

## Step 4: Refine and create your agent

Follow the Concierge agent's guided steps to fully specify your agent's
operational scope. The Concierge will help you define what financial operations
your agent should handle, from simple payment processing to complex refund
policy decisions.

Once you've fully specified the details, your new operations agent is created
and ready to connect to Stripe.

![Hypermode Create Agent](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/hypermode-create-agent.png)

Your agent will now appear in the Agents page, ready to be configured with
Stripe access.

![Hypermode Agent page](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/hypermode-agent-page.png)

## Step 5: Review your agent details

You can see the details of your agent, including the system prompt that
Concierge created for financial operations.

![Hypermode Agent details](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/hypermode-agent-details.png)

## Step 6: Refine your agent instructions

You can review the Instructions. Hypermode Agents behave as the "system prompt"
tells them. Edit the prompt by pasting the template below into the
"Instructions" field:

```text
## Description
Handles financial operations, payment processing, and refund management using Stripe

## Instructions

```

Press **Save**.

## Step 7: Add the Stripe connection

Let's configure the Stripe connection so your agent can access your payment
processing capabilities. Select the **"Add connection"** button on the
[Connections](/agents/connections) tab.

![Connect your agent](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/add-connection.png)

Search for and select **Stripe** from the available connections. You'll need to
authorize with your Stripe account credentials.

For this tutorial, we'll use Stripe's test mode. When prompted for your API key,
use your test key (starts with `sk_test_`).

<Warning>
  We recommend creating a Stripe Sandbox environment for testing and development
  purposes and creating a restricted API key for your agent. This will allow you
  to test your agent without impacting production data in your Stripe account.
  Refer to the [Hypermode Stripe connection guide](/agents/connections/stripe)
  for connection details.
</Warning>

You can also add additional connections for your operations workflow:

- **Knowledge base** (Notion or Google Docs) for _refund policies and
  procedures_
- **Internal communications** (Slack, Teams) for _notifications and approvals_
- **Accounting tools** (QuickBooks, Xero) for _financial record keeping_

![Hypermode Connections](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/hypermode-connections.png)

## Step 8: Test with payment operations

Back in threads, let's test your operations agent with some real scenarios. Try
these example requests:

### Create a test payment

```text
Can you create a payment intent for $50.00 USD for customer john@example.com?
```

Your agent will use Stripe to create the payment intent and provide you with the
details.

![Test payment creation](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/test-payment.png)

### Analyze financial data

```text
Can you show me a summary of all transactions from the past 30 days?
```

Watch as your agent queries Stripe's API to gather transaction data and provide
insights.

![Financial analysis](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/financial-analysis.png)

### Process a refund request

Let's test your agent's refund processing capabilities and the ability for the
agent to access knowledge base information. Our refund policy is stored in an
internal Notion page. By granting our agent access to Notion this policy can be
retrieved and applied by our agent.

![Refund policy](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/refund-policy.png)

```text
A customer is requesting a refund for transaction pi_3Rq5PfGb0nZyxz610ZOBBXqt.
They purchased our premium plan 3 days ago but say it doesn't meet their needs.
```

Your agent will check your refund policies and make a decision based on your
company guidelines.

![Refund processing](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/refund-processing.png)

## Step 9: Set up your Stripe test environment

To fully test your operations agent, let's populate your Stripe test environment
with sample data. Ask your agent:

```text
Can you help me set up some test data in Stripe? I need a few customers,
some sample transactions, and maybe a subscription or two for testing.
```

Your agent will create realistic test data including:

- Sample customers with various profiles
- Test payment methods using Stripe's test card numbers
- Sample successful and failed transactions
- Basic subscription plans
