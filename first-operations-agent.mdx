  "Build a Financial Operations Agent in 15 minutes using Stripe and natural
  languageâ€”no code required"
sidebarTitle: "Your First Operations Agent"
---

In this tutorial, you'll build your first AI operations agentâ€”a financial
operations agent that processes payments, manages refunds, and analyzes
financial data using Stripe through natural language commands. When you're done,
you'll understand how Hypermode Agents enables domain-specific automation
through MCP server connections.

_Who is this for?_ Anyone new to Hypermode who wants to quickly build and deploy
an operations-focused AI agent that can handle real financial workflowsâ€”no prior
experience required.

Along the way we'll explore how Hypermode Agents transforms natural language
into powerful financial operations, including the concepts of
[connections](/agents/connections) and [threads](/agents/work), specifically
applied to payment processing and financial data management.

## Prerequisites

- A [Hypermode Agents workspace](https://hypermode.com/login)
- A [Stripe account](https://stripe.com) (test mode is perfect for this
  tutorial)
- Access to your operations tools (for example, internal knowledge base) - we'll
  use Notion for this tutorial
- Basic familiarity with modern chat interfaces (no coding required)
- Estimated time: 15 minutes

## Sign in to Hypermode Agents

Head to [hypermode.com](https://hypermode.com) and sign in to Hypermode Agents.

## Creating your Stripe agent

![Create new agent](/images/connections/stripe/create-new-agent-button.png)

### Create a new agent

From the Hypermode Agents console, create a new agent:

1. Click the **Create new Agent** button from the agents view or select _Create
   new >> Create new agent_ from the threads view.
2. Enter a description of your agent

We'll use the following description for our financial operations agent:

```text
Let's build a financial operations agent that can process payments, handle
refunds, create invoices, and analyze financial data using Stripe.
```

![Create new agent modal](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/operations-agent-description.png)

### Agent profile

You can view and edit agent details in the agent profile. The agent profile
includes the agent name, description, and instructions. You can also view your
threads with this agent as well as manage the agent's tasks and knowledge.

![Agent profile](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/operations-agent-profile-view.png)

### Agent instructions

You can edit the agent instructions in the agent profile. Editing the agent's
instructions is useful for personalizing your agent and customizing how your
agent will work with you and your team.

![Create agent modal](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/edit-operations-agent-instructions.png)

## Refine your agent instructions

Optionally, you can edit the agent instructions by pasting the template below
into the "Instructions" field:

```

## Add the Stripe connection

Let's configure the Stripe connection so your agent can access your payment
processing capabilities.

To add the Stripe connection:

1. Select the Connection tab
2. Select "Connect" next to Stripe in the list of available connections

![Add Stripe connection](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-add-connection.png)

### Configure credentials

Enter your Stripe credentials:

- **API Key**: Your Stripe secret key (starts with `sk_test_` for test mode or
  `sk_live_` for live mode)

![Stripe connection modal](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-configure-connection.png)

For this tutorial, we'll use Stripe's test mode. When prompted for your API key,
use your test key (starts with `sk_test_`).

<Warning>
  We recommend creating a Stripe Sandbox environment for testing and development
  purposes and creating a restricted API key for your agent. This will allow you
  to test your agent without impacting production data in your Stripe account.
  Refer to the [Hypermode Stripe connection guide](/agents/connections/stripe)
  for connection details.
</Warning>

### Test basic connectivity

Start a new thread and test the connection with a simple query:

```text
Can you check my Stripe account balance?
```

You should see a Stripe tool call in the chat history, confirming the connection
works:

![Test connection](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-test-connection.png)

You can also add additional connections for your operations workflow:

- **Knowledge base** (Notion or Google Docs) for _refund policies and
  procedures_
- **Internal communications** (Slack, Teams) for _notifications and approvals_
- **Accounting tools** (QuickBooks, Xero) for _financial record keeping_

## Test with payment operations

### Create a test payment

```text
Can you create a payment intent for $50.00 USD for customer john@example.com?
```

Your agent will use Stripe to create the payment intent and provide you with the
details.

![Test payment creation](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/test-payment.png)

### Analyze financial data

```text
Can you show me a summary of all transactions from the past 30 days?
```

Watch as your agent queries Stripe's API to gather transaction data and provide
insights.

![Financial analysis](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/financial-analysis.png)

### Process a refund request

Let's test your agent's refund processing capabilities and the ability for the
agent to access knowledge base information. Our refund policy is stored in an
internal Notion page. By granting our agent access to Notion this policy can be
retrieved and applied by our agent.

![Refund policy](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/refund-policy.png)

```text
A customer is requesting a refund for transaction pi_3Rq5PfGb0nZyxz610ZOBBXqt.
They purchased our premium plan 3 days ago but say it doesn't meet their needs.
```

Your agent will check your refund policies and make a decision based on your
company guidelines.

![Refund processing](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/refund-processing.png)

## Set up your Stripe test environment

To fully test your operations agent, let's populate your Stripe test environment
with sample data. Ask your agent:

```text
Can you help me set up some test data in Stripe? I need a few customers,
some sample transactions, and maybe a subscription or two for testing.
```

Your agent will create realistic test data including:

- Sample customers with various profiles
- Test payment methods using Stripe's test card numbers
- Sample successful and failed transactions
- Basic subscription plans

## Comprehensive financial reporting

Our agent can generate a comprehensive financial report and email it to our
stakeholders. We'll use the following instructions to generate the report:

```text
Can you generate a Core Financial Monthly Report? Include:

- Total gross revenue (before fees/refunds)
- Net revenue (after Stripe fees, refunds, and disputes)
- Number of payments processed
- Number of refunds processed
- Number of chargebacks processed
- Number of disputes processed
- Average order value (AOV)
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Churn rate
- MRR
```

After fetching the relevant data from Stripe, our agent will generate a report:

![Financial report](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/operations-agent-financial-report.png)

We can then ask our agent to email the report to our stakeholders. We'll first
need to add the Gmail connection to our agent.

![email financial report](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/email-draft-toolcall.png)

If we check the email draft, we'll see that our agent has created a draft email
with the report attached.

![email financial report](/images/tutorials/first-operations-agent/email-draft.png)
