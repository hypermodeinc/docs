The Modus {language} SDK provides a set of APIs that allow you to interact with
various databases and services in Modus apps written in {language}. It is
designed to work seamlessly with the Modus platform, enabling you to build
powerful applications with ease.

<Info>

The Modus SDKs come in multiple languages, each following the conventions for
that language, including its capabilities and limitations. While each SDK
provides similar features, the APIs may differ slightly between languages. Be
sure to refer to the documentation for the specific SDK you're using.

Wherever possible, we've tried to keep the APIs consistent across languages.
However, you may find differences in the APIs due to language-specific
constraints.

If you have any questions or need help, please reach out to us via the `#modus`
channel on the [Hypermode Discord server](https://discord.hypermode.com/).
