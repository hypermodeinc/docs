With Model Router, you can access the most popular models with a single endpoint
and bill. Experiment with new models and scale your app without worrying about
the underlying infrastructure.

## Setup

Getting started with Model Router is simple. Generate an API key and drop it
into your favorite framework.

### Generate API key

API keys for Model Router are generated within your workspace. Generate a key by
[logging into the console](https://hypermode.com/login) and navigating to the
Model Router page.

### Connect via framework

Model Router integrates easily into the most popular frameworks.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Modus">

    To use the Model Router in a Modus app, in your [app manifest](/modus/app-manifest) create
    a connection to the Model Router and add a model that references that connection.

    ```json modus.json {11-16}
    {
        ...
      "models": {
        "meta-llama-llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct": {
          "sourceModel": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
          "connection": "model-router",
          "path": "v1/chat/completions"
        },
      },
      "connections": {
        "model-router": {
          "type": "http",
          "baseUrl": "https://models.hypermode.host/",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
          }
        }
      },
      ...

## Available models

Hypermode provides a variety of the most popular open source and commercial
models.

<Note>
  We're constantly evaluating model usage in determining new models to add to
  our catalog. Interested in using a model not listed here? Let us know at
  [help@hypermode.com](mailto:help@hypermode.com).
</Note>

### Generation

Large language models provide text generation and reasoning capabilities.

| Provider | Model                     | Slug                                       | Model Unit Multiplier |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Meta     | Llama 3.2                 | `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`         | 1                     |
| DeepSeek | DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B` | 1                     |

### Embedding

Embedding models provide vector representations of text for similarity matching
and other applications.

| Provider     | Model        | Slug                                     | Model Unit Multiplier |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Hugging Face | MiniLM-L6-v2 | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 0.1                   |
| Hugging Face | MiniLM-L6-v2 | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 0.1                   |

## Logging

By default, all model invocations are logged for future display in the console.
If you'd like to opt out of model logging, please
[contact us](mailto:help@hypermode.com).

## Billing

Hypermode Model Router simplifies how you pay for model consumption, billing by
model compute time and type. Model Units are included with all paid plans and
are calculated by taking the Model Unit Multiplier times the seconds of model
runtime across all requests.
