  "Build AI agents that act, not just chatâ€”from natural conversation to
  production-ready code"

**Connections** enable Hypermode Agents to securely access and interact with
external tools, APIs, and services. With over 2,000+ available integrations,
agents can execute tasks across your entire technology stack.

- **Built-in integrations** like GitHub, Linear, Slack, Vercel, and Notion
- **Model Context Protocol** support for secure, structured tool integration
- **2,000+ integrations** through our partnership with leading automation
  platforms
- **Your custom APIs** with encrypted credentials and scoped access
- **Major large language models** including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and open
  source models

## Overview

Hypermode Agents are built for execution, not just conversation. Connections
provide the bridge between your agents and the tools they need to complete
tasks, from internal APIs to third-party applications and public resources.

## How connections work

### Domain-specific tool assignment

Rather than providing agents with access to all available tools, Hypermode
Agents uses a curated approach based on the agent's role and domain. Examples of
connections relevant for domain specific agents include:

#### Frontend development agent

- GitHub (code repository management)
- Linear (issue tracking)
- Vercel (deployment and hosting)

#### Revenue operations agent

- Snowflake (data warehousing)
- Stripe (payment processing)
- Internal ticketing API (customer support)

#### Marketing agent

- HubSpot (CRM and automation)
- Google Analytics (website analytics)
- Mailchimp (email marketing)

### Role-based access control

<Info>
  Agents are granted access only to tools that align with their designated role,
  improving both security and decision-making clarity.
</Info>

1. **Define agent role** and primary responsibilities
2. **Select relevant tools** from the curated toolkit
3. **Configure permissions** for each integration
4. **Monitor usage** and adjust access as needed

## MCP

Connections leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide agents with
enhanced tool interaction capabilities:

### Benefits of MCP Integration

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Enhanced Reasoning" icon="brain">
    Agents understand tool capabilities and parameters as clearly as they
    understand text, enabling better planning and execution.
  </Card>

<Card title="Sophisticated Planning" icon="route">
  Multi-step workflows can be planned and executed with tools working together
  seamlessly.
</Card>

<Card title="Improved Debugging" icon="bug">
  Structured tool calls provide clear audit trails and error diagnosis
  capabilities.
</Card>

  <Card title="Tool Reusability" icon="recycle">
    Consistent tool definitions enable agents to reuse and combine tools
    effectively.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security and compliance

<Warning>
  All connections use secure authentication methods including OAuth 2.0, API
  keys, and service account credentials. Credentials are encrypted and never
  exposed to the agent's reasoning process.
</Warning>

### Security features

- **Encrypted credential storage** with enterprise-grade security
- **Audit logging** for all tool interactions
- **Permission scoping** to limit access to necessary resources only
- **Regular security updates** and compliance monitoring

## Getting started

### Add a new connection

Select a connection from the "add connections"ption from the left navigation bar
or search from more than 2000 connection options. You'll be prompted to complete
the OAuth flow if you haven't enabled the connection yet for your workspace.

Workspace settings page. Connections can also be added to your workspace from
this page.

<Tip>
  Start with a small set of essential tools for your agent's role, then expand
  as you identify additional needs through usage patterns.
