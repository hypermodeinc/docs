## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a Hypermode Agent that automatically
extracts product data from Product Hunt, enriches it with LinkedIn insights, and
stores it as a knowledge graph in Neo4j. This powerful combination allows you to
visualize relationships between products, founders, companies, and market
trends.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have an agent that:

- Scrapes Product Hunt's homepage for trending products using web search
- Enriches product data with founder and company information from LinkedIn
- Transforms the data into a knowledge graph structure
- Stores everything in Neo4j using Cypher queries

## Prerequisites

- A Hypermode account
- Neo4j AuraDB instance (free tier works fine)
- Basic understanding of graph databases (helpful but not required)

## What is a Hypermode Agent?

Hypermode Agents are AI-powered assistants that can understand instructions,
interact with external services, and perform complex tasks on your behalf.
Unlike traditional chatbots, Hypermode Agents can actually take actionsâ€”like
scraping websites, querying databases, and transforming data.

### Key Features for This Tutorial

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Give instructions in plain English
- **Multiple Connections**: Integrate with web search, LinkedIn, and Neo4j
- **Data Transformation**: Convert unstructured web data into structured graph
  relationships
- **Flexible Output**: Agents adapt their Cypher queries based on the data they
  find

## Understanding the Technologies

### Neo4j: The Graph Database

Neo4j is a graph database that stores data as nodes (entities) and relationships
(connections between entities). Unlike traditional databases that use tables and
rows, Neo4j excels at representing and querying interconnected data.

![Simple diagram showing nodes for Product, Company, and Founder connected by relationships](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/product-hunt-to-nodes.png)

### Product Hunt: The Product Discovery Platform

Product Hunt is where makers launch new products daily. It's a goldmine of data
about:

- Emerging products and startups
- Founder networks and connections
- Market trends and categories
- User engagement metrics

### Why Combine Them?

By extracting Product Hunt data into Neo4j, you can:

- Discover patterns in successful product launches
- Track founder networks and serial entrepreneurs
- Identify trending categories and technologies
- Analyze competitive landscapes

## Step 1: Create Your Knowledge Graph Agent

### Manual Agent Creation

First, let's create an agent with the following system prompt:

```text
Identity:
You are GraphBuilder, a specialized agent for extracting product data from Product Hunt and constructing knowledge graphs in Neo4j.
Your role is to discover new products, enrich them with additional context, and maintain a comprehensive graph database of the product ecosystem.

Context:
You work with web search to discover trending products from Product Hunt,
LinkedIn to gather founder and company information, and Neo4j to store everything as an interconnected knowledge graph.
You understand both web scraping techniques and Cypher query language for Neo4j.

Core Responsibilities:
1. Extract product listings from Product Hunt including:
   - Product name, tagline, and description
   - Launch date and upvote count
   - Categories and tags
   - Maker information
   - Product URLs and media

2. Enrich data using LinkedIn:
   - Founder professional backgrounds
   - Company size and funding information
   - Team member connections
   - Industry positioning

3. Transform data into graph structures:
   - Create nodes for Products, People, Companies, Categories
   - Establish relationships like CREATED_BY, WORKS_AT, BELONGS_TO
   - Add properties with timestamps and metadata

4. Maintain data quality:
   - Avoid duplicate nodes using MERGE
   - Update existing records when found
   - Preserve historical data with timestamps

Workflow Process:
For each Product Hunt extraction:
1. First check if products already exist in Neo4j
2. Search Product Hunt homepage or specific pages
3. Parse product data and identify makers
4. Search LinkedIn for maker/company details
5. Generate Cypher queries to insert/update graph
6. Execute queries and verify data integrity
7. Report on new additions and updates

Cypher Query Guidelines:
- Always use MERGE to avoid duplicates
- Add timestamps to track data freshness
- Create appropriate indexes for performance
- Use descriptive relationship types
- Include relevant properties on both nodes and relationships

When generating Cypher queries, adapt the structure based on available data.
Not all products will have the same information, so create flexible queries that handle missing data gracefully.

Always maintain data accuracy and provide clear explanations of the graph structure you're creating.
```

![Screenshot showing the agent creation form with the system prompt filled in](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/agent-creation.png)

### Select Your Model

For this use case, we recommend **Claude 4 Sonnet** or **GPT-4.1** as they excel
at:

- Understanding complex data structures
- Writing accurate Cypher queries
- Managing multi-step workflows

![Model selection dropdown showing recommended models highlighted](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/blank-sandbox.png)

## Step 2: Set Up Initial Connections

### Web Search Connection

Start with the web search capability to extract Product Hunt data:

1. Navigate to your agent's connections
2. Add "Web Search" connection
3. No authentication required for this connection

![Adding web search connection to the agent](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/agent-landing.png)

### Test Basic Extraction

Let's test our agent with a simple request:

```text
You: Search for today's trending products on Product Hunt and show me the top 5 with their makers and upvote counts.
```

Expected response structure:

```text
Agent: I'll search for today's trending products on Product Hunt.

[Searching Product Hunt homepage...]

Here are today's top 5 trending products:

1. **ProductName** - "Tagline here"
   - Makers: John Doe, Jane Smith
   - Upvotes: 245
   - Categories: AI, Productivity

2. **AnotherProduct** - "Revolutionary solution"
   - Makers: Alex Johnson
   - Upvotes: 189
   - Categories: Developer Tools

[... continues for all 5 products]
```

## Step 3: Transform Data to Cypher

Now let's have our agent convert this data into Cypher queries. Note that your
agent may generate slightly different Cypher based on the data structure it
finds:

```text
You: Convert the Product Hunt data you found into Cypher queries that create nodes for products, makers, and categories, with appropriate relationships.
```

The agent might generate queries like:

```cypher
// Create category nodes
MERGE (c1:Category {name: 'AI'})
MERGE (c2:Category {name: 'Productivity'})

// Create maker nodes
MERGE (m1:Person {name: 'John Doe'})
  ON CREATE SET m1.source = 'Product Hunt',
                m1.discovered_date = datetime()

// Create product node
MERGE (p1:Product {name: 'ProductName'})
  ON CREATE SET p1.tagline = 'Tagline here',
                p1.launch_date = date('2024-12-20'),
                p1.upvotes = 245,
                p1.product_hunt_url = 'https://producthunt.com/posts/productname',
                p1.scraped_date = datetime()
  ON MATCH SET p1.upvotes = 245,
               p1.last_updated = datetime()

// Create relationships
MERGE (m1)-[:CREATED]->(p1)
MERGE (p1)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c1)
MERGE (p1)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c2)
```

Or it might structure them differently:

```cypher
// Alternative structure with more detailed relationships
MERGE (product:Product {name: 'ProductName', tagline: 'Tagline here'})
SET product.upvotes = 245,
    product.url = 'https://producthunt.com/posts/productname',
    product.last_scraped = datetime()

MERGE (maker:Maker {name: 'John Doe'})
MERGE (maker)-[r:LAUNCHED {date: date('2024-12-20')}]->(product)

FOREACH (cat in ['AI', 'Productivity'] |
  MERGE (c:Category {name: cat})
  MERGE (product)-[:IN_CATEGORY]->(c)
)
```

## Step 4: Add LinkedIn Integration

### Connect LinkedIn

1. Add LinkedIn connection to your agent
2. Complete OAuth authentication
3. Grant necessary permissions

![LinkedIn OAuth flow](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/add-linkedin.png)

### Enrich Maker Data

Now enhance your extraction with LinkedIn data:

```text
You: For each maker you found, search LinkedIn for their professional background and current company. Add this information to the Cypher queries.
```

Enhanced Cypher output might look like:

```cypher
// Enhanced maker node with LinkedIn data
MERGE (m1:Person {name: 'John Doe'})
  SET m1.linkedin_headline = 'Founder & CEO at TechStartup',
      m1.linkedin_url = 'https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe',
      m1.current_position = 'CEO',
      m1.location = 'San Francisco, CA',
      m1.profile_updated = datetime()

// Create company node
MERGE (comp1:Company {name: 'TechStartup'})
  SET comp1.industry = 'Technology',
      comp1.employee_range = '11-50',
      comp1.founded_year = 2022

// Create employment relationship
MERGE (m1)-[emp:WORKS_AT {title: 'Founder & CEO', current: true}]->(comp1)
```

## Step 5: Connect to Neo4j

### Add Neo4j Connection

1. In your agent connections, add Neo4j AuraDB
2. Enter your connection details:
   - URI: `neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io`
   - Username: `neo4j`
   - Password: Your database password

![Neo4j connection configuration](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/add-neo4j.png)

### Finding Your Neo4j Connection Details

To connect your agent to Neo4j, you'll need your database connection details.
Here's how to find them:

![Neo4j AuraDB connection details](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/neo4j-find-browser.png)

1. Log into your Neo4j AuraDB console
2. Navigate to your database instance
3. Click on "Connect" to find your connection URI
4. You'll see something like: `neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io`

### Execute Graph Creation

```text
You: Connect to my Neo4j database and execute the Cypher queries to create the knowledge graph. After execution, run a query to show me the total number of products, makers, and relationships created.
```

## Step 6: Product Hunt Connection (Coming Soon)

<Note>
  The Product Hunt MCP server is currently being enhanced. Once available,
  you'll be able to connect directly to Product Hunt's API for more structured
  data access. For now, web search provides excellent results for extracting
  Product Hunt data.
</Note>

When the Product Hunt connection becomes available:

1. Add Product Hunt connection
2. Complete OAuth with Product Hunt
3. This will provide structured data access including:
   - Full product descriptions
   - Maker profiles with Twitter handles
   - Comment data and engagement metrics
   - Historical launch data

![Product Hunt connection card](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/add-product-hunt.png)

## Step 7: Building Useful Queries

### Create a Comprehensive Extract

```text
You: Search Product Hunt for the top 10 products launched this week. For each product:
1. Extract all available product details
2. Search LinkedIn for the makers
3. Create a comprehensive graph structure
4. Execute the queries in Neo4j
5. Show me a summary of what was created
```

### Query Your Knowledge Graph

Once your data is in Neo4j, here are powerful queries to explore your graph:

**Find Serial Entrepreneurs:**

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:CREATED|LAUNCHED]->(prod:Product)
WITH p, COUNT(prod) as product_count
WHERE product_count > 2
RETURN p.name, product_count, COLLECT(prod.name) as products
ORDER BY product_count DESC
```

**Trending Categories:**

```cypher
MATCH (c:Category)<-[:BELONGS_TO|IN_CATEGORY]-(p:Product)
WHERE p.scraped_date > datetime() - duration('P30D')
RETURN c.name, COUNT(p) as product_count, AVG(p.upvotes) as avg_upvotes
ORDER BY product_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Founder Networks:**

```cypher
MATCH (p1:Person)-[:CREATED]->(prod1:Product)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Category)<-[:BELONGS_TO]-(prod2:Product)<-[:CREATED]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1 <> p2
RETURN p1.name, p2.name, COUNT(DISTINCT c) as shared_categories
ORDER BY shared_categories DESC
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Handling Data Variations

Your agent will adapt its Cypher queries based on the data it finds. Here's how
to guide it:

```text
You: When creating Cypher queries, handle these scenarios:
- Some products may not have maker information
- Categories might be tags or topics
- Upvote counts might be ranges (e.g., "100+")
- Companies might have multiple name variations

Create flexible queries that handle missing data gracefully.
```

### Competitive Analysis

Extend your agent to find relationships between products:

```text
You: For products in similar categories, create SIMILAR_TO relationships with a similarity score based on:
- Shared categories
- Similar keywords in taglines
- Launch timing proximity
```

### Data Quality Checks

Ensure your graph maintains quality:

```text
You: After adding new data, run these quality checks:
1. Find any duplicate products (same name, different nodes)
2. Identify makers without any products
3. List products without categories
4. Show me any data quality issues found
```

## Best Practices

### Data Modeling

- Use consistent node labels (Product, Person, Company, Category)
- Keep relationship types descriptive (CREATED_BY, WORKS_AT, BELONGS_TO)
- Add timestamps to track data freshness
- Store source URLs for data verification

### Performance Optimization

- Create indexes on frequently queried properties:
  ```cypher
  CREATE INDEX product_name IF NOT EXISTS FOR (p:Product) ON (p.name);
  CREATE INDEX person_name IF NOT EXISTS FOR (p:Person) ON (p.name);
  CREATE INDEX category_name IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:Category) ON (c.name);
  ```

### Error Handling

- Your agent should handle missing data gracefully
- Use MERGE to prevent duplicate nodes
- Include data source attribution
- Log any extraction failures for review

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Web Search Limitations:**

- Product Hunt may have anti-scraping measures
- Data might be loaded dynamically
- Solution: Try different search queries or specific Product Hunt URLs

**Duplicate Nodes:**

- Always use MERGE with unique identifiers
- Normalize names (trim whitespace, consistent casing)
- Run periodic deduplication:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (p1:Product), (p2:Product)
  WHERE p1.name = p2.name AND id(p1) < id(p2)
  RETURN p1.name, COUNT(*) as duplicates
  ```

**LinkedIn Rate Limiting:**

- LinkedIn has strict rate limits
- Solution: Process makers in batches
- Cache LinkedIn data to avoid repeated lookups

## Next Steps

### Expand Your Graph

1. **Add More Data Sources:**

   - GitHub for technical products
   - Twitter/X for social metrics
   - Company websites for additional details

2. **Build Analytics:**

   - Create dashboards with Neo4j Bloom
   - Export insights to visualization tools
   - Track trends over time

3. **Enhance the Agent:**
   - Add specific industry focus
   - Create custom extraction patterns
   - Build comparison capabilities

## Example Complete Workflow

Here's a full conversation showing the complete process:

````text
You: Let's build a knowledge graph of this week's AI products on Product Hunt.
Search for AI-related products, enrich with LinkedIn data, and create the graph in Neo4j.

Agent: I'll help you build a knowledge graph of this week's AI products from Product Hunt.
Let me break this down into steps:

1. First, I'll search for recent AI products on Product Hunt
2. Extract product details and maker information
3. Enrich maker profiles using LinkedIn
4. Generate and execute Cypher queries to build the graph
5. Provide a summary of the created graph

Let me start by searching for AI products...

[Web search for "Product Hunt AI products this week"]

I found several interesting AI products. Here are the top ones:

1. **AI Code Assistant Pro** - "Your AI pair programmer for faster development"
   - Maker: Sarah Chen
   - Upvotes: 342
   - Categories: AI, Developer Tools

[... more products ...]

Now let me search LinkedIn for the makers...

[LinkedIn searches for each maker]

I've found additional information about the makers. Now I'll create the Cypher queries:

```cypher
// Create AI category
MERGE (ai:Category {name: 'AI'})

// Create Sarah Chen with LinkedIn data
MERGE (sarah:Person {name: 'Sarah Chen'})
SET sarah.linkedin_headline = 'AI Engineer & Founder',
    sarah.company = 'TechVentures',
    sarah.location = 'San Francisco, CA',
    sarah.profile_url = 'linkedin.com/in/sarahchen'

// Create product
MERGE (aicode:Product {name: 'AI Code Assistant Pro'})
SET aicode.tagline = 'Your AI pair programmer for faster development',
    aicode.upvotes = 342,
    aicode.launch_week = date('2024-12-16'),
    aicode.product_hunt_url = 'producthunt.com/posts/ai-code-assistant-pro'

// Create relationships
MERGE (sarah)-[:CREATED {role: 'Founder'}]->(aicode)
MERGE (aicode)-[:IN_CATEGORY]->(ai)
````

[Executes queries in Neo4j]

Graph successfully created! Summary:

- Products added: 8
- People added: 12
- Companies added: 7
- Categories: 5
- Total relationships: 35

The graph now contains this week's AI products with enriched founder
information.

```
