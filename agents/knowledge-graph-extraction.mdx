## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a Hypermode Agent that automatically
extracts product data from Product Hunt, enriches it with LinkedIn insights, and
stores it as a knowledge graph in Neo4j. This powerful combination allows you to
visualize relationships between products, founders, companies, and market
trends.

## What you'll build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have an Agent that:

- Scrapes Product Hunt's homepage for trending products using web search
- Enriches product data with founder and company information from LinkedIn
- Transforms the data into a knowledge graph structure
- Stores everything in Neo4j using Cypher queries

## Prerequisites

- A [Hypermode Pro](https://hypermode.com/login) account
- A [Neo4j Sandbox](https://sandbox.neo4j.com/) or AuraDB instance (free tier
  works fine)
- Basic understanding of graph databases (helpful but not required)

## What's a Hypermode Agent?

[Hypermode Agents](/agents/overview) are domain specific AI-powered assistants
created with natural language instructions that can understand instructions,
interact with external services, and perform complex tasks on your behalf.
Unlike traditional chatbots, Hypermode Agents can actually take actions—like
scraping websites, querying databases, and transforming data.

![Screenshot of Hypermode Agents interface showing an Agent card with connections](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/agent-profile.png)

### Key features for this tutorial

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Give instructions in plain English
- **Multiple Connections**: Integrate with web search, LinkedIn, and Neo4j
- **Data Transformation**: Convert unstructured web data into structured graph
  relationships
- **Flexible Output**: Agents adapt their Cypher queries based on the data they
  find

## Understanding the Technologies

### Neo4j: the graph database

Neo4j is a graph database that stores data as nodes (entities) and relationships
(connections between entities). Unlike traditional databases that use tables and
rows, Neo4j excels at representing and querying interconnected data.

![Neo4j Banner](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/what-is-neo4j.png)

### Product Hunt: the product discovery platform

Product Hunt is where makers launch new products daily - it's a goldmine of data
about:

- Emerging products and startups
- Founder networks and connections
- Market trends and categories
- User engagement metrics

![Extract Nodes](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/product-hunt-to-nodes.png)

### Why combine them?

By extracting Product Hunt data into Neo4j, you can:

- Discover patterns in successful product launches
- Track founder networks and serial entrepreneurs
- Identify trending categories and technologies
- Analyze competitive landscapes

![Why combine diagram](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/why-combine-graph.png)

## Step 1: Set up Neo4j Sandbox

### Create a Neo4j Sandbox

First, you need to go to https://sandbox.neo4j.com/ and create an account. When
you get to making a database, select a blank sandbox.

![Create blank sandbox](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/blank-sandbox.png)

<Note>
  Neo4j Sandbox provides free temporary instances perfect for testing. For
  production use, consider Neo4j Aura or a self-hosted instance.
</Note>

### Get your connection details

Once created (it may take a moment), you can navigate to the HTTP tab and grab
the URL. Note you will have to modify this to use the Neo4j HTTP v2 endpoint
when adding the Neo4j connection in Hypermode Agents.

- Remove `/db/neo4j/tx/commit`
- Replace it with `/db/neo4j/query/v2`

For example:

- Original: `http://52.54.53.148:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit`
- Modified: `http://52.54.53.148:7474/db/neo4j/query/v2`

![Connection details](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/neo4j-http-connect.png)

<Info>
  The Neo4j connection in Hypermode Agents uses the [Neo4j Query HTTP API v2
  endpoint](https://neo4j.com/docs/query-api/current/), not the now deprecated
  HTTP v1 endpoint, which is why we need to modify the URL. Refer to the
  [Hypermode Agents Neo4j connection guide](/agents/connections/neo4j) for more
  information.
</Info>

### Get authentication credentials

Save this URL and then move to the connection details to grab the username and
password.

Make sure to note these details - you'll need them when setting up the
connection in Hypermode.

## Step 2: Create your knowledge graph Agent

### Manual Agent creation

Let's create an Agent specifically designed for knowledge graph extraction.
Navigate to your Hypermode workspace and create a new agent with these settings:

- **Agent Name**: KnowledgeGraphBuilder
- **Agent Title**: Product Hunt Knowledge Graph Extractor
- **Description**: Extracts product data from Product Hunt and builds knowledge
  graphs in Neo4j

![Agent creation form](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/agent-creation.png)

### System prompt

Use this comprehensive system prompt for your agent:

```text
Identity:
You are GraphBuilder, a specialized agent for extracting product data from Product Hunt and constructing knowledge graphs in Neo4j.
Your role is to discover new products, enrich them with additional context, and maintain a comprehensive graph database of the product ecosystem.

Context:
You work with web search to discover trending products from Product Hunt,
LinkedIn to gather founder and company information, and Neo4j to store everything as an interconnected knowledge graph.
You understand both web scraping techniques and Cypher query language for Neo4j.

Core Responsibilities:
1. Extract product listings from Product Hunt including:
   - Product name, tagline, and description
   - Launch date and upvote count
   - Categories and tags
   - Maker information
   - Product URLs and media

2. Enrich data using LinkedIn:
   - Founder professional backgrounds
   - Company size and funding information
   - Team member connections
   - Industry positioning

3. Transform data into graph structures:
   - Create nodes for Products, People, Companies, Categories
   - Establish relationships like CREATED_BY, WORKS_AT, BELONGS_TO
   - Add properties with timestamps and metadata

4. Maintain data quality:
   - Avoid duplicate nodes using MERGE
   - Update existing records when found
   - Preserve historical data with timestamps

Workflow Process:
For each Product Hunt extraction:
1. First check if products already exist in Neo4j
2. Search Product Hunt homepage or specific pages
3. Parse product data and identify makers
4. Search LinkedIn for maker/company details
5. Generate Cypher queries to insert/update graph
6. Execute queries and verify data integrity
7. Report on new additions and updates

Cypher Query Guidelines:
- Always use MERGE to avoid duplicates
- Add timestamps to track data freshness
- Create appropriate indexes for performance
- Use descriptive relationship types
- Include relevant properties on both nodes and relationships

When generating Cypher queries, adapt the structure based on available data.
Not all products will have the same information, so create flexible queries that handle missing data gracefully.

Always maintain data accuracy and provide clear explanations of the graph structure you're creating.
```

### Select your model

For this use case, we recommend **Claude 4 Sonnet** or **GPT-4.1** as they excel
at:

- Understanding complex data structures
- Writing accurate Cypher queries
- Managing multi-step workflows

## Step 3: Add connections

Your agent needs key connections to function properly:

### Add Neo4j connection

1. Navigate to your agent's connections tab
2. Click "Add connection"
3. Search for "Neo4j" and select it

![Add Neo4j connection](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/add-neo4j.png)

Configure the Neo4j connection with your Sandbox details:

- **URL**: Your modified HTTP v2 endpoint
- **Username**: `neo4j` (or your custom username)
- **Password**: Your Sandbox password

![Neo4j MCP connection setup](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/neo4j-mcp-connect-http.png)

### Add LinkedIn connection

For enriching founder and company data:

1. Add the "LinkedIn" connection
2. Complete the OAuth flow to authorize access
3. This enables the agent to gather professional information

![Add LinkedIn connection](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/add-linkedin.png)

### Add Product Hunt connection

For direct Product Hunt API access (if available):

1. Add the "Product Hunt" connection if available in your workspace
2. This provides structured access to Product Hunt data

![Add Product Hunt connection](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/add-product-hunt.png)

## Step 4: Test the connection

### Verify Neo4j connectivity

Start a new thread with your agent and test the Neo4j connection:

```text
Can you connect to Neo4j and run a simple query to check if the database is empty?
```

Your agent should respond with a Cypher query and results showing the connection
is working.

![Neo4j connection test](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/query-neo4j-empty.png)

### Test web search capabilities

```text
Search for Product Hunt's trending products and tell me what the top 3 are today.
```

This verifies that your agent can access and parse Product Hunt data.

![Product Hunt search test](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/search-product-hunt.png)

## Step 5: Extract your first knowledge graph

### Start with a simple extraction

Now let's extract some real data! Try this prompt:

```text
Extract the top 5 products from Product Hunt today. For each product:
1. Get the basic product information (name, description, upvotes, etc.)
2. Look up the founders on LinkedIn to get their background
3. Create a knowledge graph in Neo4j with nodes for:
   - Product
   - Person (founders/makers)
   - Company
   - Category
4. Create appropriate relationships between these entities

Show me the Cypher queries you generate and the final graph structure.
```

### Example workflow

Your agent will follow this process:

1. **Data Search**: Search for Product Hunt trending products
2. **Data Parsing**: Extract product details, maker information
3. **LinkedIn Enrichment**: Search for founder profiles and company data
4. **Graph Construction**: Generate Cypher queries to create nodes and
   relationships
5. **Data Storage**: Execute queries in Neo4j
6. **Verification**: Query the graph to confirm data was stored correctly

### Expected output structure

Your knowledge graph will have this structure:

```cypher
// Products
(:Product {name: "ProductName", description: "...", upvotes: 150, launch_date: "2025-01-27"})

// People (founders/makers)
(:Person {name: "Founder Name", title: "CEO", linkedin_url: "..."})

// Companies
(:Company {name: "Company Name", size: "11-50", industry: "Technology"})

// Categories
(:Category {name: "AI Tools"})

// Relationships
(:Person)-[:FOUNDED]->(:Product)
(:Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(:Company)
(:Product)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Category)
(:Company)-[:CREATED]->(:Product)
```

By instructing the agent to display the database queries we can verify the
structure and content of the extracted graph before it is created in Neo4j. This
gives us the opportunity to adjust the graph structure and relationships as
needed.

## Step 6: Visualize your knowledge graph

### Open Neo4j Bloom

Once your agent has populated the database, you can visualize the results using
Neo4j Bloom, Neo4j's graph visualization tool.

- **Find your Neo4j Bloom**: Go to your Sandbox console and click "Open with
  Neo4j Bloom"

![Neo4j Bloom access](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/neo4j-open-bloom.png)

You'll need to authenticate with your Neo4j Sandbox credentials.

![Neo4j Bloom authentication](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/neo4j-bloom-auth.png)

### Generate a perspective

Once authenticated, you can generate a perspective to visualize your knowledge
graph. Perspectives are Neo4j's way of defining how to visualize graph data in
Neo4j Bloom. Let's generate a perspective from the graph data our agent has
loaded into Neo4j.

![Neo4j Bloom generate perspective](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/bloom-generate-perspective.png)

### Explore the graph

Once you've generated a perspective, you can explore the graph using Neo4j
Bloom's pattern matching search features by describing the patterns in the graph
you want to visualize.

![Neo4j Bloom pattern matching search](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/bloom-pattern-matching.png)

Bloom will then display the graph data that matches your pattern and allow you
to explore the graph interactively.

![Neo4j Bloom pattern matching results](/images/tutorials/knowledge-graph-extraction/bloom-visualization-explore.png)

## Summary

You've successfully built a Hypermode Agent that can extract, enrich, and store
Product Hunt data as a knowledge graph in Neo4j. This powerful combination
