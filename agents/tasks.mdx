Tasks are a repeatable set of instructions that you can save and use later with
your agent. Think of a task as a learned skill for your agent.

## Create task

Once you've interacted with your agent through a thread and your agent has
completed a specific activity - such as creating a recommended playlist,
updating your calendar, or genearating a research report - you can save that
activity as a task by selecting the "Create task" button.

This turns the thread into a repeatable task that you can use later to automate
your agent's workflow.
