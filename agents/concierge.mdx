## Build a new agent with Concierge

![](/images/agents/concierge.png)

**Concierge** is Hypermode's AI-powered agent builder that transforms natural
language descriptions into fully functional agents. No coding experience
required.

## Overview

Concierge streamlines agent creation by converting your requirements into
structured, working agent scaffolds through a guided process that takes just
minutes to complete.

## How It Works

### 1. Describe Your Requirements

Simply describe what you want your agent to do in natural language:

```
"I need an agent that can monitor our website for outdated landing pages,
suggest updates every Monday, and then write new headlines."
```

### 2. Configure Your Agent

Concierge guides you through:

- **Defining the agent's role** and primary objectives
- **Selecting tools** from a curated library of integrations
- **Reviewing the agent structure** and reasoning flow

### 3. Deploy and Iterate

Your agent scaffold is generated automatically with all necessary components
configured and ready for deployment.

## Why Concierge Works Better

<Tip>
  Traditional hand-written prompts often suffer from inconsistency, verbosity,
  or vagueness. Concierge solves this by using AI to author structured prompts
  that follow best practices for reasoning models.
