**What's an AI Agent?**

An AI agent is a computer program that can understand instructions, answer
questions, and help you complete tasks automatically.

**What's an MCP server?**

MCP stands for “Model Context Protocol.” An MCP server is a special part of the
agentic system that helps agents communicate, coordinate, and share information
with each other or with different tools. It acts as a central hub so agents and
tools can work together smoothly.

**What's a tool (in an agentic system)?**

A tool is a specific function or service that an agent can use to get things
done. For example, a tool might let an agent send an email, search a database,
or fetch information from the internet. Tools extend what agents can do beyond
just answering questions. Agents discover tools via MCP servers.

**What does Hypermode Agents do?**

Hypermode Agents is a tool that lets you create your own AI agents. You can set
up agents to help with things like answering questions, automating tasks, or
providing expert support—no coding required.

**Is Hypermode Agents just for developers?**

No. Hypermode Agents is designed for everyone, even if you have no coding
background.

**What can we use an AI agent for?**

You can use an AI agent to answer questions, automate repetitive work, reduce
“swivel chair” work, organize information, or assist with daily tasks.

**What if the agent doesn't work as expected?**

You can change your instructions and test again. It’s normal to adjust and
improve your agent over time.

**What's a system prompt?**

A system prompt is a set of written instructions that guides the overall agent’s
actions and responses. Think of this as defining your agent’s personality and
capabilities.

**What about information security?**

Yes. Hypermode takes privacy and security seriously and protects your data.

## Tips for training your agents

- **Give explicit instructions**
  - Example: "Any time you post a message via the Slack tool on my behalf,
    prepend your message with: 'Hypermode Agent Mr.Robot:' but only do that when
    you post in Slack. Make sure not to do so when just responding to me.'"
- **Set clear boundaries**
  - Example: "Only answer questions related to the Hypermode Agents. If asked
    about other products, politely decline."
- **Specify output format**
  - Example: “Respond using numbered steps for instructions, and use bullet
    points for lists.”
- **Provide example interactions**
  - Example:
    - User: "How do I reset my password?"
    - Agent: "1. Go to the login page. 2. Click 'Forgot Password'. 3. Follow the
      instructions sent to your email."
- **Define tone and style**
  - Example: “Use a friendly and professional tone. Keep responses under 100
    words unless more detail is requested.”
- **Anticipate common questions**
  - Example: “If a user asks about pricing, direct them to the pricing page and
    offer to connect them with sales.”
- **Tell the agent what not to do**
  - Example: “Don't provide legal or medical advice. Don't make up information
    if you are unsure.”
- **Test and revise**
  - After writing your prompt, test it with sample requests. If the agent’s
    responses are off-target, revise your instructions to be even more specific.
