  "Build AI agents that act, not just chat—from natural conversation to
  production-ready code"
---

Most AI agents today still feel like prototypes. They can generate content,
answer questions, or summarize a PDF. But when it comes to doing real
work—embedding in live apps, reducing back-office load, or following up with
customers—they fall short.

They chat. But they don't act.

**Hypermode Agents are here to change that.** Built on the latest AI advances,
Hypermode Agents are built for work, not just conversation. You'll learn what
agents can do, how they reason, and what their outputs look like, all while
building something useful from day one.

## The complete AI development platform

Hypermode is an end-to-end AI development platform designed for building,
deploying, and managing intelligent agents and knowledge graphs. It unifies
serverless compute, models, memory, integrations, observability, and debugging
tools—all in one system.

**No more stitching together fragmented solutions.** Hypermode provides
everything you need to go from concept to production agents that work reliably
at scale.

### Build agents your way

Whether you prefer natural conversation or writing code, Hypermode meets you
where you are:

**Threads**: conversational interface for domain experts to build and train
agents through natural language—no coding required.

**Modus**: open source, serverless framework for developers who want to build
agent logic, orchestration, and integrations with full control.

**The Hypermode Platform**: production-grade infrastructure that hosts and
scales your agents, whether they came from Threads or Modus.

### Vast ecosystem of integrations

**Hypermode Agents get access to a vast ecosystem of tools and integrations by
default.** Through Connections, your agents can seamlessly integrate with
popular services and your own custom APIs.

Your agents can integrate with:

- **Built-in integrations** like GitHub, Linear, Slack, Vercel, and Notion
- **Model Context Protocol** support for secure, structured tool integration
- **2,000+ integrations** through our partnership with leading automation
  platforms
- **Your custom APIs** with encrypted credentials and scoped access
- **Major large language models** including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and open
  source models

### Production-ready from day one

Unlike other platforms that require you to rebuild for production, Hypermode is
designed for real-world use:

- **Serverless infrastructure** that scales automatically and costs nothing when
  idle
- **Full observability** with inference logging, tracing, and debugging tools
- **Enterprise security** with role-based access and audit trails
- **Branch-based environments** for testing and staging
- **Open source foundation** with no vendor lock-in

## From conversation to code

The power of Hypermode is in its flexibility. Domain experts can build
sophisticated agents through conversation, while developers can export those
agents as production-ready code.

**Domain experts** work directly with agents through Threads, shaping behavior
through natural conversation and training agents with real examples.

**Platform teams** can export trained agents as complete Modus applications,
audit and version control the logic, and deploy as production microservices with
full observability.

**No information loss** between business requirements and technical
implementation. **No rebuild required** to go from prototype to production.

**Sales pipeline agent**: analyzes sales data and manages pipeline activities,
integrating Stripe, HubSpot, and Slack. A marketing agency reduced pipeline
review time from 2 hours to 15 minutes.

**Customer support agent**: analyzes support tickets and provides insights
across email and support platforms. A SaaS company reduced support triage time
from 2 hours to 20 minutes.

**Marketing insights agent**: analyzes marketing performance across channels and
provides optimization recommendations. An e-commerce brand improved campaign
return of investment by 60%.
