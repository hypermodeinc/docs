  "Build AI agents that act, not just chat—from natural conversation to
  production-ready code"
---

Most AI agents today still feel like prototypes. They can generate content,
answer questions, or summarize a PDF. But when it comes to doing real
work—embedding in live apps, reducing back-office load, or following up with
customers—they fall short.

They chat. But they don't act.

**Hypermode Agents are here to change that.** Built on the latest AI advances,
Hypermode Agents are built for work, not just conversation. You'll learn what
agents can do, how they reason, and what their outputs look like, all while
building something useful from day one.

## The complete AI development platform

Built on top of the open source Modus AI Agent Framework and the Hypermode
Platform, Hypermode Agents enables you to get started building domain specific
agents from natural language.

- **Concierge** is Hypermode's AI-powered agent that transforms natural language
  descriptions into fully functional agents. No coding experience required.
- **Threads** is a conversational interface that lets you build, train, and
  refine AI agents through natural language—no coding required. When you're
  ready, **eject to code** exports your trained agent as a complete Modus app.
- **Connections** enable Hypermode Agents to understand and interact with their
  environment. By leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, Hypermode
  Agents **Hypermode Agents get access to a vast ecosystem of tools and
  integrations by default.**
- **Tasks** are repeatable sets of instructions that you can save and use later
  with your agent. Think of a task as a learned skill for your agent.

### Production-ready from day one

Unlike other platforms that require you to rebuild for production, Hypermode is
designed for real-world use:

- **Serverless infrastructure** that scales automatically and costs nothing when
  idle
- **Full observability** with inference logging, tracing, and debugging tools
- **Enterprise security** with role-based access and audit trails
- **Branch-based environments** for testing and staging
- **Open source foundation** with no vendor lock-in

## From conversation to code

The power of Hypermode is in its flexibility. Domain experts can build
sophisticated agents through conversation, while developers can export those
agents as production-ready code.

**Domain experts** work directly with agents through Threads, shaping behavior
through natural conversation and training agents with real examples.

**Platform teams** can export trained agents as complete Modus applications,
audit and version control the logic, and deploy as production microservices with
full observability.

**No information loss** between business requirements and technical
implementation. **No rebuild required** to go from prototype to production.

## What can you build?
