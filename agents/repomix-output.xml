## Example conversation

```text
Me: Can you review the latest PR on our main repository? It's PR #142 about the new authentication system.
```

```text
Agent:
I've completed the review of PR #142 - "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication system". Here's my analysis:

**Overall Score: 8/10**

**Critical Issues:**
• Line 45 in auth.js: Hardcoded client secret should be moved to environment variables
• Line 128 in middleware.js: Missing input validation for JWT tokens could lead to injection attacks

**High Priority Suggestions:**
• Add rate limiting to login endpoints (auth.js:67-89)
• Implement proper error handling for OAuth callback failures (oauth-handler.js:34)
• Consider adding refresh token rotation for enhanced security

**Medium Priority:**
• Extract magic numbers into named constants (auth.js:23, 67, 145)
• Add JSDoc comments for public methods in AuthService class
• Consider splitting the 200-line AuthController into smaller, focused classes

**Positive Highlights:**
• Excellent test coverage at 94% - great job on comprehensive unit tests!
• Clean separation of concerns between authentication and authorization logic
• Proper use of async/await throughout the codebase
• Well-structured error messages that don't leak sensitive information

**Test Coverage Assessment:**
Strong test coverage with good edge case handling. The integration tests for OAuth flow are particularly well done.
Consider adding tests for rate limiting scenarios once implemented.

**Documentation Score: 4/5**
Good inline documentation. README updates clearly explain the new auth flow. Only missing API documentation for the new endpoints.

**Recommendation:** Approve after addressing the critical security issues. The overall architecture is solid and follows good practices.

## Instructions

```text
Identity:
You are Highland, an expert GTM Engineer and SalesOps specialist. Your job is to ensure that the sales
and marketing teams have the best and most accurate data.

You'll analyze call transcripts and keep the CRM up to date with the latest opportunity details.

Context:
Hypermode uses a Attio as its CRM.

Hypermode stores its call transcripts in Notion in the sub-page `GTM/sales/call-transcripts/`

For every call transcript you review, extract and update (or create) opportunities with these fields:
Account, Expected Close Date, Opportunity Stage, Deal Value, and Next Steps.

The schema in Attio:

Account:
The name of the account associated with the opportunity.

Expected Close Date (Date)
The date by which the opportunity is expected to close.

Next Steps (Rich Text)
Details about the next steps to be taken for the opportunity.

Deal Value (Number)
The potential value of the deal, formatted as a dollar amount.

Use the following sales roadmap to determine the correct Opportunity Stage:
- Stage 1: Prospect - Initial qualification, outreach, and discovery scheduling.
- Stage 2: Discovery - Deep technical and business requirements gathering.
- Stage 3: Evaluation - Demos, POCs, technical validation, and ROI analysis.
- Stage 4: Proposal - Proposal delivery, negotiation, and contract review.
- Stage 5: Closed Won - Contract signed, onboarding, and implementation.

If you cannot determine a close date, default to 90 days from now.
If you cannot determine deal value, default to $36,000.
Always interpret the conversation with a positive, helpful attitude, and ensure all updates are accurate and easy to understand.

Keep the Next Steps limited to no more than five bullet points with less than 5 words each.

If there is no opportunity for the "Account" in the CRM, always create a new one.

```

Agent:

Here is the opportunity analysis from the sales call transcript with ESO:

Account: Acme

Expected Close Date: 2025-09-11 (90 days from today, as no specific date was mentioned)

Opportunity Stage: Stage 2 – Discovery

The conversation focused on understanding Acme's use cases, technical requirements, and concerns
(especially around coyotes and train deployment options). There was no formal evaluation or proposal yet,
but a clear interest in a deeper technical dive and next steps.

Deal Value: $36,000 (default, as no specific value was mentioned)

Next Steps:
Schedule deeper technical dive
Share call recording internally
Address PHI data concerns
Discuss local deployment options

You are StockSense, an expert inventory management and sales tracking specialist.
Your role is to monitor Google Sheets containing inventory and sales data, identify stock issues,
track sales patterns, and provide operational recommendations to optimize inventory management.

Context:
StockSense connects to Google Sheets to analyze inventory levels, sales transactions, product performance, and supply chain data.
You focus on practical inventory management insights that help businesses avoid stockouts, reduce excess inventory, and optimize their operations.

Process:
When analyzing a Google Sheet, follow these steps:
1. First, try to list all worksheets in the spreadsheet to understand the structure
2. If that fails, ask the user which specific worksheet or data range they want analyzed
3. Retrieve the data from the main inventory/sales worksheet
4. If data retrieval fails due to connection issues, ask the user to share key data points or try a specific range
5. Focus analysis on the most critical operational insights

For every inventory/sales analysis you perform, provide insights on these areas:
- Stock Level Assessment: Identify low stock, overstock, and out-of-stock items (Current_Stock vs Reorder_Point)
- Sales Pattern Recognition: Compare Units_Sold_This_Week vs Units_Sold_Last_Week
- Reorder Recommendations: Flag items where Current_Stock is below Reorder_Point
- Product Performance: Identify highest and lowest selling items
- Category Performance: Compare sales across different product categories
- Supplier Analysis: Note which suppliers have products needing reorders

Analysis Structure:

Executive Summary (Text)
Brief overview of inventory status and most urgent actions needed.

Critical Stock Alerts (List)
Items that are out of stock (Current_Stock = 0) or below reorder point.

Sales Performance This Week (List)
Top 5 best-selling products and any notable sales changes.

Immediate Reorder Needs (List)
Products requiring immediate reordering with suggested quantities.

Category Insights (Text)

```text
Me: Can you analyze my inventory tracker spreadsheet and tell me what needs immediate attention?
```

```text
Agent:
I've analyzed your inventory tracker and here's what needs immediate attention:

**Executive Summary:**
Your inventory shows 3 critical stockouts and 8 items below reorder points that need immediate action.
Electronics category is performing exceptionally well, while some seasonal items may be overstocked.
Overall inventory health is good but requires urgent reordering for top sellers.

**Inventory Status:**
Tracking 45 products across 6 categories with generally healthy stock levels.
Most categories are well-balanced, but electronics and office supplies need immediate attention due to high sales velocity.

**Critical Actions Needed:**
• URGENT: Reorder iPhone Cases (currently out of stock, high demand)
• URGENT: Restock Bluetooth Speakers (only 2 units left, sells 15/week)
• URGENT: Order more Laptop Stands (5 units remaining, consistent seller)
• Review: Winter Jackets overstocked (85 units, slow sales in spring)

**Top Performing Products:**
• Wireless Earbuds: Consistent 20+ units sold weekly
• Phone Chargers: High turnover, steady demand
• Desk Lamps: Strong performer, good margins
• Coffee Mugs: Reliable seller across all seasons
• Notebooks: Steady office supply demand

**Stock Alerts:**
• OUT OF STOCK: iPhone Cases, Tablet Holders
• LOW STOCK (under 10 units): Bluetooth Speakers, Laptop Stands, Wireless Mice
• OVERSTOCK: Winter Jackets (85 units), Holiday Decorations (42 units)
• SLOW MOVING: Premium Headphones (22 units, 2 sold this month)

**Sales Insights:**
• Electronics category showing strongest sales momentum
• Office supplies have consistent weekly demand patterns
• Seasonal items (winter gear) declining as expected for spring
• Customer preference shifting toward wireless/portable electronics
• Weekday sales significantly higher than weekend sales

**Reorder Recommendations:**
• iPhone Cases: Order 50 units immediately (popular item)
• Bluetooth Speakers: Order 30 units (weekly demand is 15)
• Laptop Stands: Order 25 units (steady seller)
• Wireless Mice: Order 20 units (approaching minimum threshold)
• Phone Chargers: Order 40 units (high turnover item)

**Slow Movers:**
• Premium Headphones: Only 2 sold in past month, consider promotion
• Winter Jackets: Expected seasonal decline, plan clearance sale
• Holiday Decorations: Out of season, store until next year
• Specialty Cables: Low demand, reduce future orders

**Operational Notes:**
Data is well-organized and up-to-date. Sales tracking appears accurate.
Consider adding supplier lead times to optimize reorder timing.
Some product codes are missing but doesn't impact analysis.

**Next Review Actions:**
• Monitor electronics category daily due to high velocity
• Set up automatic alerts when items hit 10-unit threshold
• Review seasonal item storage and clearance strategy
• Track lead times for top 10 products to improve reorder timing
• Consider bundling slow-moving items with popular products

Would you like me to focus on any specific category or help create reorder templates for your suppliers?

connections relevant for domain specific agents include:

#### Frontend development agent

- GitHub (code repository management)
- Linear (issue tracking)
- Vercel (deployment and hosting)

#### Revenue operations agent

- Snowflake (data warehousing)
- Stripe (payment processing)
- Internal ticketing API (customer support)

#### Marketing agent

- HubSpot (CRM and automation)
- Google Analytics (website analytics)
- Mailchimp (email marketing)

### Role-based access control

<Info>
  Agents are granted access only to tools that align with their designated role,
  improving both security and decision-making clarity.
</Info>

1. **Define agent role** and primary responsibilities
2. **Select relevant tools** from the curated toolkit
3. **Configure permissions** for each integration
4. **Monitor usage** and adjust access as needed

## MCP

Connections leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide agents with
enhanced tool interaction capabilities:

### Benefits of MCP Integration

<CardGroup cols={1}>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security and compliance

<Warning>
  All connections use secure authentication methods including OAuth 2.0, API
  keys, and service account credentials. Credentials are encrypted and never
  exposed to the agent's reasoning process.
</Warning>

### Security features

- **Encrypted credential storage** with enterprise-grade security
- **Audit logging** for all tool interactions
- **Permission scoping** to limit access to necessary resources only
- **Regular security updates** and compliance monitoring

## Getting started

### Add a new connection

Select a connection from the "add connections"ption from the left navigation bar
or search from more than 2000 connection options. You'll be prompted to complete
the OAuth flow if you haven't enabled the connection yet for your workspace.

  "Create your Hypermode Agent using natural language descriptions of the
  agent's role and objectives."
---

Creating an Agent is simple and can be done
[using the built-in Hypermode Concierge agent](/agents/create-agent#build-a-new-agent-with-concierge)
or by
[specifying the agent's role and instructions yourself](/agents/create-agent#create-an-agent-manually).

## Build a new agent with Concierge

![Hypermode Concierge agent](/images/agents/concierge.png)

**Concierge** is Hypermode's AI-powered agent that transforms natural language
descriptions into fully functional agents. No coding experience required.

### Overview

Concierge streamlines agent creation by converting your requirements into
structured, working agent scaffolds through a guided process that takes just
minutes to complete.

<Steps>

<Step title="Start a new thread with Concierge">

Select the "Start a new thread" option from the left navigation bar under the
Hypermode Concierge agent.

![Start a new thread with Concierge](/images/agents/concierge-1.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Describe your agent requirements">

The Concierge agent asks some basic questions about what kind of agent you'd
like to create and the tasks you'd like the agent to take on your behalf.

![Describe your agent requirements](/images/agents/concierge-2.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Refine your agent description">

Follow the Concierge agent's guided steps to fully refine your agents role,
background, and instructions. The Concierge agent uses this information to
construct a name, description, and system prompt for your agent. Once you've
fully specified the details, your new agent is created and added to the left
navigation bar alongside the other agents in your workspace.

![Refine your agent description](/images/agents/concierge-3.png)

<Tip>
  Traditional hand-written prompts often suffer from inconsistency, verbosity,
  or vagueness. Concierge solves this by using AI to author structured prompts
  that follow best practices for models.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Enable connections and start working with your agent">

To take actions on your behalf, such as updating your calendar or submitting
code updates as pull requests, your agent needs access to connections with
services to act on your behalf. Which connections you enable for your agent
depends on the type and scope of agent to be created. For example, our product
marketing agent might need access to GitHub to be able to submit website changes
as pull requests and access to Notion to read internal messaging and product
documents.

![Enable connections and start working with your agent](/images/agents/concierge-4.png)

Once you've added connections, start chatting with your agent by asking what
they can help you with or what connections they have access to.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Create an agent manually

Agents can also be created manually by following the steps below.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create new agent">

Select the "Create new agent" option from the left navigation bar.

![Create new agent](/images/agents/manual-create-1.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Describe your agent">

Choose a name, title, and description for your agent. An agent avatar is
generated randomly but you can also upload your own avatar.

<img
  height="200"
  src="/images/agents/manual-create-2.png"
  alt="Describe your agent"
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "400px" }}
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Add your agent instructions">

The agent instructions are the system prompt that's used to guide the agent's
behavior. This is where you define the agent's role and objectives.

<img
  height="200"
  src="/images/agents/manual-create-3.png"
  alt="Add your agent instructions"
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "400px" }}
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Select your agent's model">

Select the model that you want to use for your agent. The model is used to run
the agent's instructions, including choosing how to leverage tools.

<img
  height="200"
  src="/images/agents/manual-create-4.png"
  alt="Select your agent's model"
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "400px" }}
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Enable connections and start working with your agent">

Enable connections to allow your agent to access tools and data. This is where
you define the tools that your agent has access to.

title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
sidebarTitle: "FAQs And Tips"
description: "FAQs and tips for getting the most out of Hypermode Agents"
---

**What's an AI Agent?**

An AI agent is a computer program that can understand instructions, answer
questions, and help you complete tasks automatically.

**What's an MCP server?**

MCP stands for “Model Context Protocol.” An MCP server is a special part of the
agentic system that helps agents communicate, coordinate, and share information
with each other or with different tools. It acts as a central hub so agents and
tools can work together smoothly.

**What's a tool (in an agentic system)?**

A tool is a specific function or service that an agent can use to get things
done. For example, a tool might let an agent send an email, search a database,
or fetch information from the internet. Tools extend what agents can do beyond
just answering questions. Agents discover tools via MCP servers.

**What does Hypermode Agents do?**

Hypermode Agents is a tool that lets you create your own AI agents. You can set
up agents to help with things like answering questions, automating tasks, or
providing expert support—no coding required.

**Is Hypermode Agents just for developers?**

No. Hypermode Agents is designed for everyone, even if you have no coding
background.

**What can we use an AI agent for?**

You can use an AI agent to answer questions, automate repetitive work, reduce
“swivel chair” work, organize information, or assist with daily tasks.

**What if the agent doesn't work as expected?**

You can change your instructions and test again. It is normal to adjust and
improve your agent over time.

**What's a system prompt?**

A system prompt is a set of written instructions that guides the overall agent's
actions and responses. Think of this as defining your agent's personality and
capabilities.

**What about information security?**

Yes. Hypermode takes privacy and security seriously and protects your data.

## Tips for training your agents

- **Give explicit instructions**
  - Example: "Any time you post a message via the Slack tool on behalf of the
    user, prepend your message with: 'Hypermode Agent Mr. Robot:' but only do
    that when you post in Slack. Make sure not to do so when just responding to
    the user."
- **Set clear boundaries**
  - Example: "Only answer questions related to the Hypermode Agents. If asked
    about other products, politely decline."
- **Specify output format**
  - Example: "Respond using numbered steps for instructions, and use bullet
    points for lists."
- **Provide example interactions**
  - Example:
    - User: "How to reset the password?"
    - Agent: "1. Go to the login page. 2. Click 'Forgot Password'. 3. Follow the
      instructions sent to your email."
- **Define tone and style**
  - Example: "Use a friendly and professional tone. Keep responses under 100
    words unless more detail is requested."
- **Anticipate common questions**
  - Example: "If a user asks about pricing, direct them to the pricing page and
    offer to connect them with sales."
- **Tell the agent what not to do**
  - Example: "Don't provide legal or medical advice. Don't make up information
    if you are unsure."
- **Test and revise**
  - After writing your prompt, test it with sample requests. If the agent's
    responses are off-target, revise your instructions to be even more specific.

  "Build AI agents that act, not just chat—from natural conversation to
  production-ready code"
---

Most AI agents today still feel like prototypes. They can generate content,
answer questions, or summarize a PDF. But when it comes to doing real
work—embedding in live apps, reducing back-office load, or following up with
customers—they fall short.

They chat. But they don't act.

**Hypermode Agents are here to change that.** Built on the latest AI advances,
Hypermode Agents are built for work, not just conversation. You'll learn what
agents can do, how they reason, and what their outputs look like, all while
building something useful from day one.

## The complete AI development platform

Built on top of the open source Modus AI Agent Framework and the Hypermode
Platform, Hypermode Agents enables you to get started building domain specific
agents from natural language.

![Hypermode Agents](/images/agents/threads.png)

- **Concierge** is Hypermode's AI-powered agent that transforms natural language
  descriptions into fully functional agents. No coding experience required.
- **Threads** is a conversational interface that lets you build, train, and
  refine AI agents through natural language—no coding required. When you're
  ready, **eject to code** exports your trained agent as a complete Modus app.
- **Connections** enable Hypermode Agents to understand and interact with their
  environment. By leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, Hypermode
  Agents **Hypermode Agents get access to a vast ecosystem of tools and
  integrations by default.**
- **Tasks** are repeatable sets of instructions that you can save and use later
  with your agent. Think of a task as a learned skill for your agent.

### Production-ready from day one

Unlike other platforms that require you to rebuild for production, Hypermode is
designed for real-world use:

- **Serverless infrastructure** that scales automatically and costs nothing when
  idle
- **Full observability** with inference logging, tracing, and debugging tools
- **Enterprise security** with role-based access and audit trails
- **Branch-based environments** for testing and staging
- **Open source foundation** with no vendor lock-in

## From conversation to code

The power of Hypermode is in its flexibility. Domain experts can build
sophisticated agents through conversation, while developers can export those
agents as production-ready code.

**Domain experts** work directly with agents through Threads, shaping behavior
through natural conversation and training agents with real examples.

**Platform teams** can export trained agents as complete Modus applications,
audit and version control the logic, and deploy as production microservices with
full observability.

**No information loss** between business requirements and technical
implementation. **No rebuild required** to go from prototype to production.

## What can you build?

**Sales pipeline agent**: analyzes sales data and manages pipeline activities,
integrating Stripe, HubSpot, and Slack.

**Customer support agent**: analyzes support tickets and provides insights
across email and support platforms.

**Marketing insights agent**: analyzes marketing performance across channels and
provides optimization recommendations.

---

Tasks are a repeatable set of instructions that you can save and use later with
your agent. Think of a task as a learned skill for your agent.

## Create task

Once you've interacted with your agent through a thread and your agent has
completed a specific activity - such as creating a recommended playlist,
updating your calendar, or generating a research report - you can save that
activity as a task by selecting the "Create task" button.

This turns the thread into a repeatable task that you can use later to automate
your agent's workflow.

![Create task](/images/agents/create-task-1.png)

## Use tasks

After saving a task to your agent you'll see the task in your agent's task list.
You can then use the task to automate your agent's workflow.

**Threads is where ideas become agents.** it's a conversational interface that
lets you build, train, and refine AI agents through natural language—no coding
required.

![Threads](/images/agents/threads.png)

### General guidance

- **Start simple:** Begin with a basic use case or workflow. Don't try to build
  a complex agent right away—get comfortable with the basics first.
  - You're going to need to learn to speak “agent.” You'll find some phrases are
    obvious to you but very ambiguous to an agent. The more you use Hypermode,
    the more it becomes natural.
- **Define clear goals:** Know what you want your agent to accomplish. Write
  down the specific tasks or problems you want the agent to solve.
  - For example, "goal: update the hero text on the website" then going into the
    rest of your instructions.
- **Understand inputs/outputs:** Learn what information (inputs) your agent
  needs and what kind of results (outputs) to produce.
  - Click to expand the tool calls you see streaming by as your agent works.
    Start to build an intuition around how your agent is executing work.
- **Use step-by-step instructions:** Break down tasks into small, logical steps.
  Agents perform best when instructions are clear and sequential.
- **Use check steps:** Frequently request an agent to check its work and verify
  that specific steps are completed. Today's AI is very eager to please,
  unfortunately that means it lies frequently about tasks being completed. Ask
  it to double check that specific actions have been taken.
