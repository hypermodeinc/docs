description:
  "Get familiar with Sidekick's interface and capabilities. Learn to use web
  search, LinkedIn search, and configure your agent for optimal agent
  interaction."
---

<Card title="Day 1 challenge" icon="rocket">
  **Goal**: explore Sidekick's core capabilities and configure your agent

**Theme**: foundation week - getting started with agents

**Time investment**: ~10 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to your first day with Hypermode Agents! Today you'll get familiar with
**Sidekick**, your AI-powered agent platform that goes far beyond simple chat.
You'll explore its search capabilities, learn to configure your agent, and
understand what makes agents different from traditional AI assistants.

Sidekick isn't just another chatbot—it's an intelligent agent that can search
the web, research people and companies, and integrate with your tools to take
real actions.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Explore Sidekick's interface and understand agent vs. chat differences
- Test web search capabilities with real-time information
- Try LinkedIn and professional research features

<Warning>
  This is **not** just another AI chat interface. Sidekick is designed to act on
  your behalf, search for current information, and integrate with real tools.
  You'll see the difference immediately.
</Warning>

## Step 1: explore the Sidekick interface

When you first open Sidekick, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the
interface. Notice the key elements that make this different from standard AI
chat:

**Key interface elements:**

- **Chat area**: Where you interact with Sidekick naturally
- **Sidebar connections**: Available integrations and tools
- **Model indicator**: Shows you're using GPT-4.1 (available exclusively for
  Sidekick)
- **Search indicators**: Visual cues when Sidekick is searching or taking
  actions

![Sidekick Interface Tour - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day1-interface-tour.png)

**Start with a simple greeting:**

```text
Hello Sidekick! I'm starting the 30 Days of Agents program.
Can you tell me what makes you different from other AI assistants?
```

Notice how Sidekick explains its capabilities and agent-like features.

<Tip>
  **Agent learning moment** Sidekick can take real actions, not just provide
  suggestions. This fundamental difference shapes how you interact with it.
</Tip>

## Step 2: test web search capabilities

One of Sidekick's core strengths is real-time web search. Let's test this with
current information:

**Try this search request:**

```text
Can you search for the latest news about AI developments this week?
I'm particularly interested in any major announcements or breakthroughs.
```

![Web Search Demo - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day1-web-search.png)

Watch how Sidekick:

- Automatically searches current web sources
- Synthesizes information from multiple results
- Provides recent, relevant findings
- Cites sources for verification

**Try another search:**

```text
What are the current stock market trends today?
Focus on technology companies and any market-moving news.
```

Notice how Sidekick retrieves real-time information and presents it in a
structured, actionable format.

## Step 3: explore LinkedIn and professional research

Sidekick excels at professional research. Let's test its ability to find and
analyze professional information:

**Try this LinkedIn-style research:**

```text
Can you research Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn?
I'd like to know about his current activities, recent posts or articles, and any speaking engagements or interviews.
```

![LinkedIn Research Demo - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day1-linkedin-research.png)

Sidekick can:

- Search for current professional information
- Find recent articles, interviews, or posts
- Provide context about current business activities
- Organize information for professional networking purposes

**Try company research:**

```text
I'm interested in learning about Anthropic's recent developments.
Can you research their latest product announcements, funding news, and key executives?
```

<Tip>
  **Pro insight** Sidekick's research goes beyond basic Google searches. It
  synthesizes professional context that's actually useful for business
  relationships and decision-making.
</Tip>

## Step 4: configure your agent settings

<img
  className="w-80 mx-auto"
  src="/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day1-agent-config.png"
  alt="Agent Configuration - Placeholder"
/>

<Card title="Day 2 challenge" icon="calendar">
  **Goal**: show value with real productivity tasks

**Theme**: foundation week - agent productivity in action

**Time investment**: ~10 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 2! Yesterday you explored Sidekick's interface and search
capabilities. Today you'll get Sidekick to work on real productivity
tasks—researching contacts for meetings, connecting your Google Calendar, and
experiencing how agents handle actual work scenarios.

Building on yesterday's foundation, you'll see how agent capabilities translate
into immediate productivity gains.

![Sidekick Interface - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/sidekick-about.png)

## What you'll accomplish today

- Research a contact for an upcoming meeting
- Connect your Google Calendar
- Create a calendar event through conversation
- Experience how agents think and respond to real work tasks

<Warning>
  This builds on yesterday's introduction. You'll now see Sidekick in action
  with real productivity scenarios, not just exploration.
</Warning>

## Step 1: research your contact

Let's start with a classic scenario: you have a meeting with someone, and you
want to be prepared. We'll use Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, as our example.

**Start a new conversation with Sidekick** and try this prompt:

```text
I am meeting with Sam Altman from OpenAI tomorrow.
Can you research him and prepare some notes for me?
```

![Sidekick Research - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day2-research.png)

Watch how Sidekick:

- Searches for current information about Sam Altman (building on yesterday's web
  search learning)
- Organizes findings into actionable meeting notes
- Provides context that's actually useful for conversation
- Includes recent developments and OpenAI updates

<Tip>
  **Agent learning moment**: notice how Sidekick structures information for
  practical use, not just information dump. This is the difference between
  search and intelligence.
</Tip>

## Step 2: connect Google calendar

Now let's connect your Google Calendar so Sidekick can manage your schedule.

1. **Add the Google Calendar connection** from the connections panel
2. **Complete the OAuth flow** when prompted
3. **Confirm connection** in your workspace settings

![Google Calendar Connection - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day2-calendar-connect.png)

<Info>
  Google Calendar is already configured in Sidekick. Want access to 2,000+ more
  connections? [Upgrade to Hypermode Pro](/agents/connections).
</Info>

## Step 3: create your meeting

With your calendar connected, let's schedule that meeting with Sam Altman:

```text
Create an event tomorrow at 2pm PT for my meeting with Sam Altman.
Title it "Meeting with Sam Altman - OpenAI Discussion" and add the research notes you prepared as the description.
Since we don't have Sam's actual email, please use [YOUR_EMAIL_HERE] as a placeholder for the attendee.
```

![Calendar Event Creation - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day2-create-event.png)

Sidekick:

- Creates the calendar event at the specified time
- Includes your research notes in the description
- Confirms the meeting details

## What just happened?

Building on yesterday's exploration, you've now experienced practical agent
productivity:

**Applied intelligence** - Sidekick didn't just search—it prepared actionable
meeting notes with current information about Sam Altman and OpenAI

**Real integration** - Connected to your actual tools (Google Calendar)

**Seamless action** - Created the calendar event with research included, not
just provide suggestions

**Natural workflow** - All through conversation, no forms or complex interfaces

**Current information** - Used web search (from yesterday's learning) to get the
latest information about your contact

## The power of integrated workflow

Unlike yesterday's exploratory interactions, today you've seen how Sidekick
connects multiple capabilities—research, calendar integration, and intelligent
action—into seamless workflows that mirror how you actually work.

<Card
  title="Tomorrow - Day 3"
  icon="arrow-right"
  href="/agents/30-days-of-agents/day-3"
>
  Connect more deeply with your schedule. Learn to have Sidekick draft your
  morning stand-up updates based on your calendar.
</Card>

## Pro tip for today

Before tomorrow's session, try asking Sidekick:

```text
What did you learn about my work style and preferences from our interactions yesterday and today?
```

This begins training Sidekick to understand your specific needs and
communication style across multiple sessions.

---

**Time to complete**: ~10 minutes

**Skills learned**: practical agent research, calendar integration, workflow
automation, real-world task delegation

**Next** day 3 - Morning stand-up automation with calendar intelligence

<Tip>
  **Remember** you're not just using a tool—you're training an assistant. Every
  interaction teaches Sidekick more about how you work, building on the
  foundation from Day 1.

<Card title="Day 3 challenge" icon="calendar-check">
  **Goal**: automate your daily stand-up preparation

**Theme**: foundation week - calendar intelligence

**Time investment**: ~10 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 3! Yesterday you experienced how Sidekick researches and creates
calendar events. Today we're going deeper into calendar intelligence—having
Sidekick understand your schedule and automatically draft your daily stand-up
updates.

This is where you see the power of agents that understand context, not just
commands.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Ensure your Google Calendar connection is active
- Have Sidekick analyze your day's schedule
- Generate a draft stand-up update based on your meetings
- Experience how agents interpret calendar context

<Warning>
  This isn't about reading your calendar aloud. Sidekick analyzes meeting
  patterns, identifies priorities, and suggests talking points for your
  stand-up.
</Warning>

## Step 1: verify your calendar connection

If you completed Day 2, your Google Calendar should already be connected. Let's
verify and explore what Sidekick can see:

**Ask Sidekick:**

```text
What meetings do I have today? Can you see my calendar?
```

![Calendar Connection Status - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day3-calendar-check.png)

Sidekick should be able to:

- List your meetings for today
- Show meeting times and attendees
- Identify meeting types (1:1&nbsp;s, team meetings, external calls)

<Info>
  If your calendar isn't connected, follow the connection steps from Day 2.
  Sidekick guides you through the OAuth flow.
</Info>

## Step 2: request your stand-up draft

Now for the magic. Instead of manually reviewing your calendar and thinking
about what to share in stand-up, let Sidekick do the analysis:

```text
Based on my calendar today, can you draft my morning stand-up update?
Include what I'm working on, any blockers you can identify from my schedule, and what I focus on today.
```

![Stand-up Draft Generation - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day3-standup-draft.png)

Watch how Sidekick:

- Analyzes your meeting types and identifies work streams
- Spots potential scheduling conflicts or back-to-back meetings
- Suggests priorities based on meeting importance and attendees
- Drafts talking points in a natural, conversational tone

<Tip>
  **Agent learning moment**: notice how Sidekick infers context from calendar
  data, and how it's interpreting patterns and making intelligent suggestions.
</Tip>

## Step 3: refine your stand-up style

Your stand-up format might be different from Sidekick's initial draft. Let's
teach it your team's style:

```text
Our stand-ups follow this format:
- Yesterday's accomplishments
- Today's priorities (max 3 items)
- Any blockers or help needed

Can you redraft my update in this format? Also, our team prefers bullet points over paragraphs.
```

![Stand-up Format Refinement - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day3-format-update.png)

Sidekick adapts the content to match your team's preferred structure and
communication style.

## Step 4: identify intelligent insights

Ask Sidekick to go beyond basic calendar reading:

```text
Looking at my schedule, what patterns do you notice?
Are there any potential issues or opportunities for improving my day?
```

Sidekick might identify:

- **Time blocks**: "You have three 1:1&nbsp;s back-to-back 2–3:30 PM"
- **Preparation needs**: "Your client presentation at 4 PM follows immediately
  after your team planning session"
- **Travel time**: "Note the location change between your 10 AM and 11 AM
  meetings"
- **Energy management**: "Consider scheduling buffer time before your most
  important calls"

## What just happened?

In just 10 minutes, you've experienced sophisticated calendar intelligence:

**Context understanding** Sidekick doesn't just read calendar entries—it
interprets meeting types, identifies work streams, and understands priorities

**Pattern recognition** It spots scheduling conflicts, preparation
opportunities, and ways to optimize your approach

**Communication intelligence** It adapts content format and tone to match your
team's communication style

**Proactive insights** Beyond the immediate request, it offers strategic
suggestions for time management

## The power of calendar intelligence

Unlike static calendar apps, Sidekick understands the story your schedule tells.
It can identify when you're overbooked, suggest optimal meeting prep time, and
even recognize when you need buffer time between high-stakes meetings.

```

This teaches Sidekick to think strategically about your time management, not
just report what's scheduled.

- Learn how agents connect calendar data to communication strategies

<Warning>
  This isn't about copying calendar entries. Sidekick analyzes meeting types,
  attendees, and context to suggest specific talking points, potential outcomes,
  and strategic follow-up actions.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Request your daily agenda preparation

Building on yesterday's calendar intelligence, let's have Sidekick create a
comprehensive agenda for your day:

**Ask Sidekick:**

```text
Based on my calendar today, can you prepare my daily agenda with contextual notes for each meeting?
Include suggested talking points, potential outcomes, and any preparation I should do beforehand.
```

![Daily Agenda Preparation](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day4-agenda-prep.png)

Watch how Sidekick:

- Analyzes each meeting's purpose based on title, attendees, and timing
- Suggests specific talking points relevant to each meeting type
- Identifies potential decisions or outcomes to prepare for
- Recommends pre-meeting preparation based on attendee profiles
- Notes optimal meeting flow and transition strategies

<Tip>
  **Agent learning moment** notice how Sidekick infers meeting context and
  purpose from minimal calendar data. it's using pattern recognition to suggest
  relevant business outcomes and conversation topics.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Generate meeting-specific preparation notes

Let's get more specific about your most important meeting today:

```text
For my most important meeting today, can you create detailed preparation notes?
Include background research on attendees, suggested agenda items, potential objections or questions I might face, and key outcomes I should aim for.
```

![Meeting Preparation Notes](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day4-meeting-prep.png)

Sidekick provides:

- **Attendee context**: roles, recent company news, potential interests
- **Strategic talking points**: relevant to meeting objectives and attendee
  priorities
- **Anticipated challenges**: common objections or difficult questions to
  prepare for
- **Success metrics**: clear outcomes to aim for and how to measure meeting
  success

## Step 3: Draft follow-up email templates

Now for the powerful part—having Sidekick prepare email follow-ups before
meetings even happen:

```text
Based on my agenda today, can you draft email templates for potential follow-up actions?
Create templates for: meeting recap emails, action item assignments, scheduling next steps, and sharing relevant resources.
Tailor each template to the specific meeting type and attendees.
```

![email Template Generation](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day4-email-templates.png)

Sidekick creates customized templates such as:

- **Meeting recap emails**: structured summaries with key decisions and next
  steps
- **Action item assignments**: clear task delegation with deadlines and context
- **Follow-up scheduling**: templates for booking next meetings based on
  outcomes
- **Resource sharing**: contextual document or link sharing based on discussion
  topics

<Tip>
  **Pro insight** Sidekick tailors language, formality, and content based on
  attendee relationships, meeting types, and your communication history.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Strategic day optimization

Ask Sidekick to go beyond agenda creation to strategic optimization:

```text
Looking at my full agenda, what strategic opportunities should I watch for today?
Are there any cross-meeting synergies, networking possibilities, or ways to maximize the value of my time?
```

Sidekick might identify:

- **Cross-meeting connections**: "your 2 PM discussion about budget could inform
  your 4 PM vendor meeting"
- **Relationship opportunities**: "two attendees from different meetings work on
  related projects—consider introducing them"
- **Information leverage**: "insights from your morning client call could
  strengthen your afternoon proposal presentation"
- **Energy management**: "schedule your most challenging conversation after your
  team win at 11 AM"

## What just happened?

In 10 minutes, you've experienced sophisticated daily intelligence:

**Predictive preparation** Sidekick doesn't just read your calendar—it
anticipates meeting needs, potential outcomes, and required follow-up actions

**Context-aware communication** email templates aren't generic—they're tailored
to specific relationships, meeting types, and expected outcomes

**Strategic management** Beyond individual meetings, Sidekick identifies
cross-meeting opportunities and day optimization strategies

**Proactive action planning** Rather than reactive follow-ups, you now have
prepared templates that anticipate common meeting outcomes

## The power of contextual intelligence

Unlike basic calendar apps or generic email templates, Sidekick understands the
flow of business relationships and decision-making. It connects the dots between
meetings, anticipates outcomes, and prepares you for the communication
strategies that drive business forward.

  Reflection Friday - Sidekick summarizes what it learned about you this week
  and reflects on your agent interaction patterns for continuous improvement.
</Card>

## Pro tip for today

After each meeting today, tell Sidekick what actually happened:

```text
My 2 PM meeting with [person] went differently than expected. Here's what actually happened: [brief summary].
How should I adjust my follow-up approach and what can you learn for future meeting preparation?
```

This teaches Sidekick to improve its meeting prediction accuracy and follow-up
suggestions based on real outcomes.

**Time to complete**: ~10 minutes

**Skills learned**: agenda preparation, predictive meeting analysis, email
template generation, strategic day optimization, contextual intelligence

**Next** day 5 - reflection and optimization based on week's learning

<Tip>
  **Remember** each interaction teaches Sidekick more about your meeting
  patterns, communication style, and business context. The agent is learning to
  anticipate not just what you'll need, but when and how you'll need it.

<Card title="Day 5 Challenge" icon="lightbulb">
  **Goal**: reflect on your agent transformation and prepare for advanced weeks

**Theme**: foundation week wrap-up - from exploration to intelligent action

**Time investment**: ~10 minutes

</Card>

Congratulations! You've completed your first week with Hypermode Agents. Take a
moment to appreciate what you've accomplished—you've moved from exploring agent
interfaces to sophisticated workflow automation in just five days.

This is the start of your journey, and it's the foundation for everything that's
coming next.

## Your week in review

Let's look at the remarkable progression you've made:

### Day 1: first contact with the agent platform

- **What you did**: Explored Sidekick's interface, tested web search and
  LinkedIn research
- **What you learned**: Agents have real-time capabilities and professional
  research tools
- **Key insight**: "This feels different from every AI I've used before"

### Day 2: agent productivity in action

- **What you did**: Researched contacts and connected your Google Calendar
- **What you learned**: Agents integrate with real tools and take concrete
  actions
- **Key insight**: "it's not just chatting—it's actually doing work for you"

### Day 3: calendar intelligence emerges

- **What you did**: Automated stand-up generation from calendar analysis
- **What you learned**: Agents understand context and patterns, not just
  commands
- **Key insight**: "it's interpreting your schedule, not just reading it"

### Day 4: predictive thinking automation

- **What you did**: Daily agenda prep with contextual notes and email templates
- **What you learned**: Agents can anticipate needs and prepare solutions
- **Key insight**: "it's thinking ahead about what I'll need"

### Day 5: the transformation is complete

- **What you've become**: An agent collaboration expert
- **What you've learned**: The difference between tools and intelligent partners
- **Key insight**: "Using AI has evolved to working with it"

## The fundamental shift

In just one week, you've experienced the most important transition in knowledge
work since the spreadsheet:

**From exploring → to directing** **From commands → to collaboration** **From
tools → to teammates**

Most people use AI to generate content or answer questions. You've learned to
delegate judgment, enable intelligent reasoning, and think strategically about
time and priorities. That's the difference between AI users and agent builders.

## What makes this different

**Traditional AI**: "Generate a meeting agenda for the 2 PM call" **Your
approach now**: "Based on priorities and calendar patterns, optimize the entire
day and prepare strategic follow-ups for anticipated outcomes"

**Traditional AI**: "Write an email about the project update" **Your approach
now**: "Analyze communication style, understand the recipient context, and draft
messaging that advances strategic objectives"

This sophistication didn't happen by accident. You've been training yourself to
think in agent collaboration, not AI requests.

## The weeks ahead

You've mastered the foundations. Now the real power unlocks.

The next 20 days take you deeper into custom agent creation, and what you can
achieve with Hypermode Agents.

<Card title="Day 7 challenge" icon="robot">
  **Goal**: collaborate with Concierge to design, name, and deploy your first custom agent

**Theme**: community week - from problem to deployed agent

**Time investment**: ~20 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 7! Yesterday you joined the community and unlocked Hypermode Pro.
Today's challenge is to work with **Concierge** to take a problem you're facing,
iterate through the requirements, gather the necessary connections, and emerge
with a named, deployed agent sitting in your sidebar ready for interaction.

This is your first complete agent creation cycle—from idea to deployed teammate.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Meet Concierge and start the iterative agent design challenge
- Work through problem definition, requirements gathering, and connection
  identification
- Collaborate until you have a complete agent specification
- Deploy your named agent to your sidebar, ready for Day 8 configuration
- Share your deployed agent concept with the community

<Warning>
  This requires Hypermode Pro access from Day 6. If you don't have your Pro
  access code yet, use the fast track program or participate in Discord
  community events to unlock additional capabilities.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Meet Concierge - the meta-agent

Concierge is fundamentally different from Sidekick. While Sidekick is a
productivity agent, Concierge is a **meta-agent**—an AI that specializes in
building other AIs using the same advanced reasoning capabilities you've
experienced all week.

**Start a conversation with Concierge:**

```text
Hi Concierge! I'm on Day 7 of the Agents Bootcamp.
I'd like to understand how you help people build custom agents.
What's your process for turning ideas into working agents?
```

![Concierge Introduction](/images/agents/concierge.png)

Watch how Concierge:

- Explains its role as a collaborative agent builder
- Describes how it helps you think through what you want to solve
- Walks through the discovery process for understanding your needs
- Shows how ideas become specifications that become living agents

<Tip>
  **Agent builder mindset** notice how Concierge approaches agent creation—it
  starts with understanding your problem space, not jumping to solutions.
</Tip>

## Step 2: The iterative design challenge

Your challenge today is to work with Concierge through multiple iterations until
you have a complete agent ready for deployment. This isn't just a
conversation—it's a structured problem-solving process that results in a working
agent.

**Begin the challenge:**

```text
Concierge, I want to take on the Day 7 challenge. I have a problem I'm facing: [describe your challenge or workflow pain point]
Let's work together to turn this into a deployed agent. What do you need to know first?
```

**Example problem areas to consider:**

- Customer research and feedback analysis
- Competitive intelligence and market tracking
- Content creation and social media management
- Sales pipeline management and lead qualification
- Code review and development workflow automation
- Financial analysis and reporting
- Project management and team coordination

  Marketing Insights, GTM Engineer, and Competitor Content Tracker. Each example
  shows the problem solved, connections used, and implementation approach.
</Card>

![Concierge Agent Creation](/images/agents/concierge-2.png)

**The iterative process you'll experience:**

- **Problem definition** - Concierge helps you clearly articulate the challenge
  you're solving
- **Requirements gathering** - What specific outcomes do you need? What does
  success look like?
- **Capability mapping** - What tools and integrations does your agent need to
  succeed?
- **Personality design** - How should your agent communicate and behave?
- **Connection identification** - Which of the 2,000+ Pro integrations are
  essential?
- **Specification refinement** - Multiple rounds of "what about" and "have you
  considered"
- **Agent naming** - Choosing the perfect name that reflects your agent's role
  and personality
- **Deployment decision** - When both you and Concierge agree it's ready to
  deploy

<Info>
  This iterative process continues until you and Concierge reach consensus that
  your agent specification is complete. Once deployed, your named agent then
  appears in your sidebar, ready for connection configuration on Day 8.
</Info>

<Info>
  Behind the scenes, Concierge is building a comprehensive prompt that captures
  your agent's design. This same process creates the foundation for reusable
  actions you'll learn about on Day 9. Every conversation is building toward
  scalable, repeatable workflows.
</Info>

## Step 3: Share your deployed agent with the community

Once your agent is named and deployed to your sidebar, share your success with
the community for celebration, feedback, and inspiration.

<Card
  title="Share in Discord Community"
  icon="discord"
  href="https://discord.gg/HssAhQE3"
>
  Post in #agent-bootcamp about the agent you just deployed. Share your
  challenge, solution, and celebrate with other builders completing the Day 7
  challenge.
</Card>

**Share your deployed agent:**

```text
Day 7 Challenge Complete! 🎉

Agent Name: [Your agent's name]
Problem Solved: [Brief description of the challenge]
Key Capabilities: [What your agent can do]

  **Goal**: provide the tools your agent needs to accomplish its goals

**Theme**: community week - enabling agent capabilities

**Time investment**: ~20 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 8! Yesterday you created your first custom agent with Concierge.
Today we're diving deep into **connections and tools**—the integration ecosystem
that transforms chatbots into powerful agents. You'll learn to connect services
and understand what specific tools become available for your agent to use.

This is where agents evolve from helpful assistants to business-critical
automation.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Configure your deployed agent with the right connections
- Master the agent configuration interface and customization options
- Understand connection authorization flow and management
- Learn the difference between connections and tools
- Explore your agent's specific tool capabilities with its new connections
- Learn to iterate on agent instructions and model selection

<Warning>
  This builds on Day 7's agent creation. You'll need the custom agent you
  deployed yesterday to complete today's configuration and workflow development.
</Warning>

## Understanding connections and tools

Before diving into configuration, it's important to understand the distinction:

<Info>
  **Connection**: the authenticated integration to a service (for example: "Google sheets connection")

**Tools**: the specific actions your agent can perform once connected (for
example: "create spreadsheet", "update row", "fetch data")

</Info>

{/* <!-- trunk-ignore(markdownlint/MD036) --> */} **Google Sheets**

- **Connection**: OAuth authentication to your Google account
- **Tools unlocked**: Create, edit, and manage spreadsheets, rows, and data.

{/* <!-- trunk-ignore(markdownlint/MD036) --> */} **GitHub**

- **Connection**: Authentication to your GitHub account
- **Tools unlocked**: Create and manage repositories, pull requests, issues, and
  more.

This distinction helps you understand what capabilities your agent gains from
each connection you enable.

## Step 1: Explore your agent's configuration interface

Your agent from yesterday is now deployed in your sidebar, but let's dive into
its configuration options. The agent interface gives you powerful customization
capabilities.

<img
  className="w-1/2 mx-auto"
  src="/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day-8-agent-about.png"
  alt="Agent About View"
/>

**Access your agent's configuration:**

1. **Click on your agent** in the sidebar to open its thread view
2. **Click the agent's name** at the top to access the "About" section
3. **Review the agent details** including its description, instructions, and
   current model

**Key configuration options available:**

- **Agent Instructions**: Edit the system prompt that guides your agent's
  behavior
- **Model Selection**: Currently set to GPT-4.1 (default), but you can
  experiment with other models
- **Agent Description**: Update how your agent presents itself
- **Connection Management**: Add and configure the services your agent can
  access

<Tip>
  **Customization power**: you have full control over your agent's instructions
  and model. GPT-4.1 is the default and works great for most use cases, but you
  can experiment with different models or collaborate with us on Discord to find
  what works best for your specific needs.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Model awareness**: not all models support tool use. GPT-4.1 is the most
  capable for this purpose, but you can experiment with others if you want to
  explore different behaviors.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Add connections through the agent interface

Now let's give your agent access to the services it needs. The connections
interface makes this straightforward.

<img
  className="w-1/2 mx-auto"
  src="/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day-8-agent-connections.png"
  alt="Agent Connections View"
/>

**Configure connections via agent interface:**

1. **Navigate to the Connections tab** in your agent's about section
2. **Browse available connections** or search for specific services your agent
   might need
3. **Click "Add Connection"** for services that align with your agent's purpose
4. **Complete the OAuth flow** when prompted for authentication
5. **Verify successful connection** with the green checkmark indicator

**Connection selection strategy:**

Think about what your agent was designed to do (from Day 7) and add connections
that support those capabilities. For example:

- **Code-related agents**: GitHub connection (unlocks repository management, PR
  creation tools)
- **Marketing agents**: HubSpot connection (unlocks CRM management, campaign
  tracking tools)
- **Research agents**: Google Drive connection (unlocks document access,
  creation tools)
- **Operations agents**: Google Sheets connection (unlocks spreadsheet
  management, data analysis tools)

<Tip>
  **Connection vs. Tools reminder**: when you add a Google Sheets connection,
  you're not just connecting to Google Sheets—you're unlocking specific tools
  like "create spreadsheet," "update row," and "analyze data." Each connection
  provides multiple tools for your agent to use.
</Tip>

<Info>
  **Start focused**: add 2-3 connections initially rather than overwhelming your
  agent with too many options. You can always add more as you discover new use
  cases.
</Info>

## Step 3: Alternative connection management options

Besides the agent interface, you have other ways to manage connections across
your workspace.

<img
  className="w-1/2 mx-auto"
  src="/images/agents/connections-sidebar.png"
  alt="Agent Connections View"
/>

**Sidebar connection access:**

- **Click "Add connections"** from the left navigation bar
- **Search through 2,000+ integrations** to find specific services
- **Complete OAuth flows** directly from the sidebar

![Connections Management](/images/agents/connections-manage.png)

**Workspace-level management:**

1. **Navigate to Workspace Settings** from your profile menu
2. **Click the Connections tab** to see all available integrations
3. **Add connections** that can be shared across multiple agents
4. **Manage authentication status** and review permissions

<Info>
  **Multiple access points**: whether you use the agent interface, sidebar, or
  workspace settings depends on your preference. All methods give you access to
  the same powerful integration ecosystem.
</Info>

## Step 4: Test your agent's new tool capabilities

Now that your agent has connections, let's explore what specific tools it can
use. Start with simple requests to understand how it uses its new capabilities.

**Test basic tool awareness:**

```text
What connections do you have access to now? What specific tools can you use with each connection?
```

Your agent can:

- **List available connections** and explain the services it can access
- **Describe specific tools** it can use with each connection
- **Suggest workflows** based on your agent's role and available tools

**Try a simple task:**

```text
Can you help me with [specific task related to your agent's purpose]?
Use whatever tools you think are most appropriate.
```

Watch how your agent:

- **Evaluates available tools** for the task at hand
- **Plans its approach** using the specific tools you've provided
- **Executes actions** across the integrated services
- **Reports results** and suggests next steps

<Tip>
  **Discovery approach**: rather than prescribing specific workflows, let your
  agent show you what's possible. Ask open-ended questions about what it can
  help you accomplish with its current tools.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Customize your agent's instructions and model

The configuration interface gives you direct control over your agent's behavior.
You can edit the agent's prompt and experiment with different models right from
the About section.

**Direct customization options:**

1. **Edit Agent Instructions**: Click "Edit" to modify the system prompt that
   guides your agent's behavior
2. **Change Model Selection**: Switch from the default GPT-4.1 to experiment
   with other models
3. **Update Description**: Adjust how your agent presents itself

**When to customize:**

- **Tool usage patterns**: Guide which tools to prioritize for specific tasks
- **Tone adjustments**: Make the agent more formal, casual, technical, or
  business-focused
- **Process preferences**: Specify how the agent should approach tasks
- **Communication style**: Adjust how the agent reports progress and results

**Model experimentation:**

GPT-4.1 is the default and works great for most use cases, but you can
experiment with different models based on your needs. If you're unsure about
optimization, collaborate with us on Discord to find what works best for your
specific requirements.

<Info>
  **Direct control**: unlike other platforms, you have full access to customize
  your agent's instructions and model selection. This gives you complete control
  over behavior and performance.
</Info>

## What you've accomplished

In 20 minutes, you've mastered agent configuration and tool enablement:

**Interface mastery**: learned to navigate and customize your agent through the
About section, including instructions and model selection

**Connection configuration**: successfully added relevant connections through
multiple access methods - agent interface, sidebar, and workspace settings

**Tool capability exploration**: tested your agent's new abilities and
discovered what specific tools are available with each connection

**Direct customization**: learned to edit agent instructions and experiment with
different models for optimal performance

**Optimization awareness**: understand when and how to get community support for
advanced optimization

## The transformation from advisor to executor

Today's work establishes the foundation for powerful agent automation:

**Before connections**: your agent could only provide advice and suggestions
based on its training

**After connections**: your agent can take real actions with specific tools,
access live data, and integrate with your actual workflows and business systems

This transformation from "advisor" to "executor" is what makes Hypermode Agents
different from traditional AI assistants.

  "Learn to capture successful workflows as reusable tasks. Transform one-time
  interactions into scalable, repeatable skills that enhance your agent's
  capabilities and organizational productivity."
---

<Card title="Day 9 challenge" icon="repeat">
  **Goal**: create reusable tasks from successful workflows

**Theme**: community week - workflow optimization and reusability

**Time investment**: ~15 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 9! Over the past two days, you've built custom agents and
sophisticated workflows. Today you'll learn to capture these successes as
**reusable tasks**—turning one-time interactions into scalable, repeatable
skills that anyone can use.

Tasks are how agent capabilities evolve from experimental to institutional
knowledge.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Understand the difference between conversations and tasks
- Use the Create Task button to automatically generate reusable workflows
- Edit and refine auto-generated task prompts
- Experience how tasks transform agent utility

<Warning>
  This builds on Days 7-8's agent creation and workflow development. You'll need
  the custom agent and workflows you've built to complete today's activities.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding tasks vs. conversations

Before creating tasks, understand what makes them powerful:

**Conversations** are exploratory and unique:

- One-time problem solving
- Iterative refinement and discovery
- Learning and experimentation
- Context-specific solutions

**Tasks** are structured and repeatable:

- Standardized workflows
- Consistent outputs
- Scalable across users and scenarios
- Institutional knowledge capture

<Tip>
  **The task mindset** think about which workflows would be valuable if someone
  else could execute them without needing to understand all the context and
  iteration that went into creating them.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Identify task-worthy workflows

Look for conversations that have these characteristics:

**Clear workflow patterns:**

- Multi-step processes that worked well
- Consistent input/output structures
- Logical sequences that could be repeated
- Successful outcomes worth replicating

**High reusability potential:**

- Processes you'll need again with different inputs
- Workflows that could benefit other team members
- Patterns that work across different scenarios

### Common task patterns

**Research and analysis workflows:**

- Market research with standardized reporting
- Competitive analysis with consistent frameworks
- Customer feedback analysis and insights

**Automation workflows:**

- Meeting preparation with agenda and research
- Project status reporting across tools
- Content creation and distribution processes

## Step 3: using the create task button

After completing a successful workflow with your agent, look for the **Create
Task** button in the bottom left of your interface.

![Create Task Button](/images/agents/create-task-button.png)

### How the create task button works

1. **Click the Create Task button** in the bottom left after a successful
   workflow
2. **Hypermode analyzes your conversation** to identify repeatable patterns
3. **Auto-generates a task prompt** that captures the workflow essence
4. **You can edit and refine** the generated prompt before saving

### The automatic analysis process

When you click Create Task, Hypermode:

- **Identifies the core workflow** from your conversation
- **Extracts key parameters** that could be customized
- **Generates a structured prompt** that preserves the successful pattern
- **Suggests a task name and description** based on the workflow

### Editing your task prompt

The auto-generated prompt appears for you to review and refine:

![Create Task Interface](/images/agents/create-task-1.png)

**You can edit:**

- Task name and description for clarity
- Prompt instructions to add specificity
- Parameter definitions for customization
- Output format requirements

<Info>
  The Create Task button uses AI to automatically identify reusable patterns and
  generate prompts, but you have full control to refine and perfect the task
  before saving.
</Info>

## Step 4: Using your saved tasks

Once you've refined and saved your task, it becomes available as a reusable
workflow:

![Task Pills](/images/agents/invoke-task.png)

### How saved tasks work

- **Task pills** appear proceeding the chat interface
- **Click any task** to invoke it with new parameters
- **Provide new inputs** while maintaining the proven workflow structure
- **Get consistent outputs** that follow the pattern you established

### Testing your task

Click on your newly created task and test it with different inputs to ensure it
works reliably across various scenarios.

## What you've accomplished

In 15 minutes, you've mastered the task creation workflow:

**Automated workflow capture** used the Create Task button to automatically
identify and capture successful patterns

**Prompt refinement skills** learned to edit auto-generated prompts for maximum
effectiveness

**Scalable productivity** created tasks that others can execute with one-click
invocation

**Quality control** developed the ability to refine AI-generated task prompts
for better outcomes

**Institutional knowledge creation** transformed individual expertise into
repeatable organizational capabilities

## The power of automated task creation

The Create Task button represents a breakthrough in knowledge capture:

**Traditional approach**: manually document processes, hope people follow them,
lose institutional knowledge when people leave

**Automated approach**: one-click capture of successful workflows, AI-generated
prompts that preserve expertise, instant availability for team reuse

This is how modern organizations can scale expertise without losing the nuance
of what actually works.

```text
Me: What new topics are our top three competitors publishing about this month? Are there any messaging trends we should be aware of?
```

```text
Agent:
I've analyzed the content strategies of your top three AI platform competitors over the past month. Here's your competitive intelligence briefing:

**Executive Summary:**
Major shift toward "AI agents in production" messaging across all competitors, with 67% increase in content about enterprise deployment.
Two competitors are heavily pushing "no-code AI" positioning, while one is doubling down on developer-first messaging.
Clear opportunity for Hypermode to own the "speed to production" narrative that none are effectively addressing.

**Competitor Content Analysis:**

**Competitor A (LangChain/LangSmith):**
- **Primary Themes**: Production AI deployment (34% of content), enterprise security (23%), developer ecosystem (18%)
- **Top Performing Content**: "From prototype to production in 30 days" case study (1.2K LinkedIn engagements)
- **Publishing Cadence**: 12 posts/week across LinkedIn + Twitter, 2 blog posts/week
- **Key Messaging**: "The platform developers trust for production AI"

**Competitor B (OpenAI Platform):**
- **Primary Themes**: Model capabilities (41% of content), API improvements (27%), safety/alignment (16%)
- **Top Performing Content**: GPT-4 Turbo technical demos (850 LinkedIn shares)
- **Publishing Cadence**: 8 posts/week, heavy focus on LinkedIn + developer forums
- **Key Messaging**: "Building AGI for everyone" with developer accessibility focus

**Competitor C (Anthropic Claude for Work):**
- **Primary Themes**: Enterprise AI adoption (38%), safety-first development (29%), business transformation (20%)
- **Top Performing Content**: "AI transformation without the risk" whitepaper (2.1K downloads)
- **Publishing Cadence**: 6 posts/week, strong emphasis on thought leadership
- **Key Messaging**: "Safe, reliable AI for serious business applications"

**Trending Topics & Messaging This Month:**
• **"AI Agents vs. Copilots"** - All three competitors positioning their approach as superior (47 pieces of content)
• **"Production AI at Scale"** - Heavy focus on enterprise deployment stories and case studies
• **"AI Safety in Enterprise"** - Increased emphasis on security, compliance, and risk management
• **"Developer Experience Revolution"** - Competition around who has the best DX for AI development
• **"ROI Measurement for AI"** - New trend around quantifying business impact and success metrics

**Content Performance Insights:**
Highest engagement content types across competitors:
1. **Technical deep-dives with code examples** (avg. 340 engagements)
2. **Customer success stories with specific metrics** (avg. 280 engagements)
3. **Thought leadership on AI market trends** (avg. 220 engagements)
4. **Interactive demos and live coding sessions** (avg. 190 engagements)

**Publishing Strategy Analysis:**
- **Timing**: Tuesday-Thursday posts get 40% higher engagement than Monday/Friday
- **Platform Mix**: LinkedIn driving 60% of B2B engagement, Twitter for developer community
- **Content Formats**: Video content up 85% month-over-month across all competitors
- **Frequency**: Weekly thought leadership + 2-3 tactical/product posts optimal for engagement

**Competitive Positioning Gaps:**
All competitors are missing these angles that Hypermode could own:
• **Time-to-Production Focus**: None effectively messaging speed advantage
• **Agent-First Architecture**: Competitors still positioning agents as features, not core platform
• **Developer-to-Business Bridge**: Gap between technical capabilities and business outcomes
• **Real-world Agent Examples**: Lack of concrete, relatable agent use cases

**Content Gap Opportunities (Immediate):**
• **"Why AI Agents Fail in Production"** - None addressing common deployment failures
• **"Agent ROI Calculator"** - Interactive tool showing business impact of agent implementation
• **"5-Minute Agent Deployment"** - Speed comparison content against competitors
• **"Agent Architecture Explained"** - Technical content for developers comparing approaches

**Content Gap Opportunities (Strategic):**
• **Agent marketplace concept** - None discussing ecosystem/community approaches
• **Industry-specific agent frameworks** - Missing vertical-specific content
• **Agent monitoring and observability** - Limited content on post-deployment management
• **Agent collaboration patterns** - Multi-agent system content gap

**Recommended Action Items (Immediate - 1-2 weeks):**
• **Create "Agent vs. Copilot" comparison piece** - Capitalize on trending topic with Hypermode's unique angle
• **Develop production deployment case study** - Counter competitors' enterprise messaging with speed focus
• **Launch "5-Minute Friday" video series** - Quick agent deployment demos to showcase speed advantage
• **Write "The Hidden Cost of Slow AI Development"** thought leadership piece

**Recommended Action Items (Strategic - 1-2 months):**
• **Develop comprehensive agent marketplace vision** - Own the ecosystem narrative
• **Create agent monitoring/observability content series** - Address post-deployment gap
• **Build interactive agent ROI calculator** - Competitive tool for sales and marketing
• **Launch customer spotlight series** - Real businesses using agents successfully

**Message Differentiation Ideas:**
• **Speed Narrative**: "While others talk about enterprise-ready, we deliver production-ready in minutes"
• **Agent-First Positioning**: "Built for agents from the ground up, not retrofitted for agents"
• **Developer Experience**: "Code agents like you code applications - natural, fast, powerful"
• **Business Impact Focus**: "Agents that actually move business metrics, not just tech demos"

**Competitive Response Opportunities:**
• **Counter "no-code" messaging** with "right-code" positioning - emphasize developer control
• **Challenge "safety-first" with "speed-first, secure-by-design"** approach
• **Differentiate from "platform" messaging** with "agent development framework" positioning

**Market Trend Alerts:**
⚠️ **Enterprise Security Focus**: All competitors increasing security/compliance content - Hypermode should address this gap
⚠️ **Video Content Surge**: 85% increase in video across competitors - consider increasing video production
⚠️ **Developer Community Engagement**: Competitors building stronger developer communities - opportunity for Hypermode

**Next Week Monitoring Focus:**
- Track responses to enterprise security messaging trends
- Monitor engagement on competitor video content for format insights
- Watch for new partnership announcements that could shift messaging
- Analyze developer community discussions for emerging pain points

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific competitor's strategy or create detailed content briefs for the recommended topics?

```text
Me: Can you review the latest PR on our main repository? It's PR #142 about the new authentication system.
```

```text
Agent:
I've completed the review of PR #142 - "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication system". Here's my analysis:

**Overall Score: 8/10**

**Critical Issues:**
• Line 45 in auth.js: Hardcoded client secret should be moved to environment variables
• Line 128 in middleware.js: Missing input validation for JWT tokens could lead to injection attacks

**High Priority Suggestions:**
• Add rate limiting to login endpoints (auth.js:67-89)
• Implement proper error handling for OAuth callback failures (oauth-handler.js:34)
• Consider adding refresh token rotation for enhanced security

**Medium Priority:**
• Extract magic numbers into named constants (auth.js:23, 67, 145)
• Add JSDoc comments for public methods in AuthService class
• Consider splitting the 200-line AuthController into smaller, focused classes

**Positive Highlights:**
• Excellent test coverage at 94% - great job on comprehensive unit tests!
• Clean separation of concerns between authentication and authorization logic
• Proper use of async/await throughout the codebase
• Well-structured error messages that don't leak sensitive information

**Test Coverage Assessment:**
Strong test coverage with good edge case handling. The integration tests for OAuth flow are particularly well done.
Consider adding tests for rate limiting scenarios once implemented.

**Documentation Score: 4/5**
Good inline documentation. README updates clearly explain the new auth flow. Only missing API documentation for the new endpoints.

**Recommendation:** Approve after addressing the critical security issues. The overall architecture is solid and follows good practices.

Agent:
I've analyzed your inventory tracker and here's what needs immediate attention:

**Executive Summary:**
Your inventory shows 3 critical stockouts and 8 items below reorder points that need immediate action.
Electronics category is performing exceptionally well, while some seasonal items may be overstocked.
Overall inventory health is good but requires urgent reordering for top sellers.

**Inventory Status:**
Tracking 45 products across 6 categories with generally healthy stock levels.
Most categories are well-balanced, but electronics and office supplies need immediate attention due to high sales velocity.

**Critical Actions Needed:**
• URGENT: Reorder iPhone Cases (currently out of stock, high demand)
• URGENT: Restock Bluetooth Speakers (only 2 units left, sells 15/week)
• URGENT: Order more Laptop Stands (5 units remaining, consistent seller)
• Review: Winter Jackets overstocked (85 units, slow sales in spring)

**Top Performing Products:**
• Wireless Earbuds: Consistent 20+ units sold weekly
• Phone Chargers: High turnover, steady demand
• Desk Lamps: Strong performer, good margins
• Coffee Mugs: Reliable seller across all seasons
• Notebooks: Steady office supply demand

**Stock Alerts:**
• OUT OF STOCK: iPhone Cases, Tablet Holders
• LOW STOCK (under 10 units): Bluetooth Speakers, Laptop Stands, Wireless Mice
• OVERSTOCK: Winter Jackets (85 units), Holiday Decorations (42 units)
• SLOW MOVING: Premium Headphones (22 units, 2 sold this month)

**Sales Insights:**
• Electronics category showing strongest sales momentum
• Office supplies have consistent weekly demand patterns
• Seasonal items (winter gear) declining as expected for spring
• Customer preference shifting toward wireless/portable electronics
• Weekday sales significantly higher than weekend sales

**Reorder Recommendations:**
• iPhone Cases: Order 50 units immediately (popular item)
• Bluetooth Speakers: Order 30 units (weekly demand is 15)
• Laptop Stands: Order 25 units (steady seller)
• Wireless Mice: Order 20 units (approaching minimum threshold)
• Phone Chargers: Order 40 units (high turnover item)

**Slow Movers:**
• Premium Headphones: Only 2 sold in past month, consider promotion
• Winter Jackets: Expected seasonal decline, plan clearance sale
• Holiday Decorations: Out of season, store until next year
• Specialty Cables: Low demand, reduce future orders

**Operational Notes:**
Data is well-organized and up-to-date. Sales tracking appears accurate.
Consider adding supplier lead times to optimize reorder timing.
Some product codes are missing but doesn't impact analysis.

**Next Review Actions:**
• Monitor electronics category daily due to high velocity
• Set up automatic alerts when items hit 10-unit threshold
• Review seasonal item storage and clearance strategy
• Track lead times for top 10 products to improve reorder timing
• Consider bundling slow-moving items with popular products

Would you like me to focus on any specific category or help create reorder templates for your suppliers?

Me: Based on our latest customer interviews and sales data, what new buyer personas are emerging? How should we update our messaging for each?
```

```text
Agent:
I've analyzed your latest customer interviews, survey data, and CRM information to identify persona evolution and emerging segments.
Here's your comprehensive persona intelligence report:

**Executive Summary:**
Analysis of 247 customer interviews and 1,834 survey responses reveals three distinct persona shifts and two entirely new emerging segments.
Traditional "Technical Decision Maker" persona is splitting into specialized roles, while a new "AI-First Startup" segment is rapidly growing.
Overall, customers are becoming more sophisticated in AI requirements and demanding faster implementation timelines.

**Primary Personas (Updated):**

**1. Enterprise AI Architect (Evolved)**
- **Demographics**: 500+ employee companies, Senior/Principal Engineer roles, 8+ years experience
- **Key Changes**: Now prioritizing security compliance (87% mention) vs. previous focus on scalability
- **Pain Points**: "We need AI that passes SOC2 audits without months of implementation" (survey quote)
- **Messaging Update**: Lead with enterprise security and compliance capabilities, not just performance

**2. Startup Technical Founder (Refined)**
- **Demographics**: 5-50 employee companies, CTO/Founding Engineer, building first AI features
- **Evolution**: Shifted from "build vs. buy" to "speed vs. control" decision framework
- **New Priority**: Time-to-market over customization (73% prioritize speed)
- **Messaging Update**: Emphasize "production-ready in days" rather than "highly customizable"

**3. Platform Engineering Lead (Stable)**
- **Demographics**: 100-500 employee companies, manages developer productivity tools
- **Consistency**: Persona remains stable with developer experience as primary concern
- **Messaging**: Continue current developer-first positioning and technical documentation focus

**Emerging Segments (High Confidence):**

**4. AI-First Startup Founder (NEW)**
- **Size**: 47 customers identified, growing 25% monthly
- **Profile**: Non-technical founders building AI-native products, 1-10 employees
- **Pain Points**: "I understand the business value but get lost in technical implementation"
- **Unique Needs**: Business-focused onboarding, success metrics dashboards, clear ROI tracking
- **Recommended Messaging**: "Build AI products without an engineering team"

**5. Digital Transformation Director (NEW)**
- **Size**: 23 customers identified, primarily from traditional industries
- **Profile**: Business leaders driving AI adoption at established companies (manufacturing, retail, finance)
- **Pain Points**: "Our teams are resistant to change and we need proven, low-risk AI solutions"
- **Unique Needs**: Change management support, pilot program structures, executive reporting
- **Recommended Messaging**: "Proven AI transformation with minimal business disruption"

**Persona Evolution Insights:**
Traditional boundaries are blurring as AI becomes mainstream. Technical personas are becoming more business-focused,
while business personas are becoming more technically sophisticated.
Key trend: 68% of respondents now evaluate AI solutions based on "business impact" rather than "technical capabilities."

**Pain Point Analysis (Priority Order):**
• **Security & Compliance** (89% of Enterprise): SOC2, GDPR, industry-specific requirements
• **Implementation Speed** (76% of Startups): "Months of setup" is the #1 competitor advantage point
• **Developer Experience** (71% of Platform Teams): API quality, documentation, debugging tools
• **Cost Predictability** (63% of All): Surprise usage costs and unclear pricing models
• **Integration Complexity** (58% of Enterprise): Existing system compatibility and data migration

**Messaging Recommendations:**

**Enterprise AI Architect:**
- **Current**: "Build production AI applications with enterprise-grade infrastructure"
- **Updated**: "Deploy compliant AI applications with zero security compromises"
- **Key Words**: Compliant, secure, audit-ready, enterprise-grade

**Startup Technical Founder:**
- **Current**: "Powerful, flexible AI development platform"
- **Updated**: "Ship AI features in days, not months"
- **Key Words**: Fast, production-ready, immediate impact, competitive advantage

**AI-First Startup Founder:**
- **New Messaging**: "Turn AI ideas into products without technical complexity"
- **Key Words**: Business-friendly, guided setup, clear metrics, proven results

**Digital Transformation Director:**
- **New Messaging**: "Risk-free AI pilot programs with measurable business impact"
- **Key Words**: Low-risk, proven methodology, executive visibility, gradual adoption

**Content Strategy Insights:**
Personas are consuming different content types than 6 months ago:
- **Technical personas** want more code examples and architectural deep-dives (vs. previous preference for high-level overviews)
- **Business personas** want case studies with specific ROI metrics and implementation timelines
- **All personas** prefer interactive demos over static content (74% preference increase)
- **Video content** gaining traction for complex technical concepts (52% prefer video explanations)

**Channel Optimization:**
• **LinkedIn**: Most effective for reaching Enterprise AI Architects and Digital Transformation Directors
• **Developer Communities** (GitHub, Discord): Critical for Platform Engineering Leads and Technical Founders
• **Email**: AI-First Founders prefer email nurturing sequences with business-focused content
• **Webinars**: High engagement for technical deep-dives with Enterprise personas
• **Product Hunt/Indie Maker Communities**: Emerging channel for AI-First Startup Founders

**Competitive Positioning:**
**Enterprise vs. Competitors**: Position against "complex enterprise solutions" with message "enterprise security without enterprise complexity"
**Startup vs. Competitors**: Position against "developer-only tools" with message "technical power with business clarity"
**New Segments**: Less competitive awareness, opportunity to define category positioning

**Research Recommendations:**
1. **Conduct deeper interviews with Digital Transformation Directors** (sample size: 23 is below confidence threshold)
2. **Survey Platform Engineering Leads on AI observability needs** (emerging theme in recent interviews)
3. **Analyze churn data by persona** to validate messaging effectiveness
4. **Track persona distribution changes monthly** to catch emerging segments early

**Immediate Action Items:**
• Update website messaging for Enterprise segment to lead with compliance
• Create business-focused onboarding flow for AI-First Founder segment
• Develop ROI calculator tool for Digital Transformation Directors
• A/B test speed-focused vs. flexibility-focused messaging for Startup Technical Founders

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific persona or create detailed messaging frameworks for the new segments?

## How connections work

### Domain-specific tool assignment

Rather than providing agents with access to all available tools, Hypermode
Agents uses a curated approach based on the agent's role and domain. Examples of
connections relevant for domain specific agents include:

#### Frontend development agent

- GitHub (code repository management)
- Linear (issue tracking)
- Vercel (deployment and hosting)

#### Revenue operations agent

- Snowflake (data warehousing)
- Stripe (payment processing)
- Internal ticketing API (customer support)

#### Marketing agent

- HubSpot (CRM and automation)
- Google Analytics (website analytics)
- Mailchimp (email marketing)

### Role-based access control

<Info>
  Agents are granted access only to tools that align with their designated role,
  improving both security and decision-making clarity.
</Info>

1. **Define agent role** and primary responsibilities
2. **Select relevant tools** from the curated toolkit
3. **Configure permissions** for each integration
4. **Monitor usage** and adjust access as needed

## MCP

Connections leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide agents with
enhanced tool interaction capabilities:

### Benefits of MCP Integration

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Enhanced Reasoning" icon="brain">
    Agents understand tool capabilities and parameters as clearly as they
    understand text, enabling better planning and execution.
  </Card>

<Card title="Sophisticated Planning" icon="route">
  Multi-step workflows can be planned and executed with tools working together
  seamlessly.
</Card>

<Card title="Improved Debugging" icon="bug">
  Structured tool calls provide clear audit trails and error diagnosis
  capabilities.
</Card>

  <Card title="Tool Reusability" icon="recycle">
    Consistent tool definitions enable agents to reuse and combine tools
    effectively.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security and compliance

<Warning>
  All connections use secure authentication methods including OAuth 2.0, API
  keys, and service account credentials. Credentials are encrypted and never
  exposed to the agent's reasoning process.
</Warning>

### Security features

- **Encrypted credential storage** with enterprise-grade security
- **Audit logging** for all tool interactions
- **Permission scoping** to limit access to necessary resources only
- **Regular security updates** and compliance monitoring

## Getting started

### Add a new connection

Select a connection from the "add connections"ption from the left navigation bar
or search from more than 2000 connection options. You'll be prompted to complete
the OAuth flow if you haven't enabled the connection yet for your workspace.

  "Create your Hypermode Agent using natural language descriptions of the
  agent's role and objectives."
---

Creating an Agent is simple and can be done
[using the built-in Hypermode Concierge agent](/agents/create-agent#build-a-new-agent-with-concierge)
or by
[specifying the agent's role and instructions yourself](/agents/create-agent#create-an-agent-manually).

## Build a new agent with Concierge

![Hypermode Concierge agent](/images/agents/concierge.png)

**Concierge** is Hypermode's AI-powered agent that transforms natural language
descriptions into fully functional agents. No coding experience required.

### Overview

Concierge streamlines agent creation by converting your requirements into
structured, working agent scaffolds through a guided process that takes just
minutes to complete.

<Steps>

<Step title="Start a new thread with Concierge">

Select the "Start a new thread" option from the left navigation bar under the
Hypermode Concierge agent.

![Start a new thread with Concierge](/images/agents/concierge-1.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Describe your agent requirements">

The Concierge agent asks some basic questions about what kind of agent you'd
like to create and the tasks you'd like the agent to take on your behalf.

![Describe your agent requirements](/images/agents/concierge-2.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Refine your agent description">

Follow the Concierge agent's guided steps to fully refine your agents role,
background, and instructions. The Concierge agent uses this information to
construct a name, description, and system prompt for your agent. Once you've
fully specified the details, your new agent is created and added to the left
navigation bar alongside the other agents in your workspace.

![Refine your agent description](/images/agents/concierge-3.png)

<Tip>
  Traditional hand-written prompts often suffer from inconsistency, verbosity,
  or vagueness. Concierge solves this by using AI to author structured prompts
  that follow best practices for models.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Enable connections and start working with your agent">

To take actions on your behalf, such as updating your calendar or submitting
code updates as pull requests, your agent needs access to connections with
services to act on your behalf. Which connections you enable for your agent
depends on the type and scope of agent to be created. For example, our product
marketing agent might need access to GitHub to be able to submit website changes
as pull requests and access to Notion to read internal messaging and product
documents.

![Enable connections and start working with your agent](/images/agents/concierge-4.png)

Once you've added connections, start chatting with your agent by asking what
they can help you with or what connections they have access to.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Create an agent manually

Agents can also be created manually by following the steps below.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create new agent">

Select the "Create new agent" option from the left navigation bar.

![Create new agent](/images/agents/manual-create-1.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Describe your agent">

Choose a name, title, and description for your agent. An agent avatar is
generated randomly but you can also upload your own avatar.

<img
  height="200"
  src="/images/agents/manual-create-2.png"
  alt="Describe your agent"
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "400px" }}
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Add your agent instructions">

The agent instructions are the system prompt that's used to guide the agent's
behavior. This is where you define the agent's role and objectives.

<img
  height="200"
  src="/images/agents/manual-create-3.png"
  alt="Add your agent instructions"
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "400px" }}
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Select your agent's model">

Select the model that you want to use for your agent. The model is used to run
the agent's instructions, including choosing how to leverage tools.

<img
  height="200"
  src="/images/agents/manual-create-4.png"
  alt="Select your agent's model"
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "400px" }}
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Enable connections and start working with your agent">

Enable connections to allow your agent to access tools and data. This is where
you define the tools that your agent has access to.

![Enable connections and start working with your agent](/images/agents/manual-create-5.png)

title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
sidebarTitle: "FAQs And Tips"
description: "FAQs and tips for getting the most out of Hypermode Agents"
---

**What's an AI Agent?**

An AI agent is a computer program that can understand instructions, answer
questions, and help you complete tasks automatically.

**What's an MCP server?**

MCP stands for “Model Context Protocol.” An MCP server is a special part of the
agentic system that helps agents communicate, coordinate, and share information
with each other or with different tools. It acts as a central hub so agents and
tools can work together smoothly.

**What's a tool (in an agentic system)?**

A tool is a specific function or service that an agent can use to get things
done. For example, a tool might let an agent send an email, search a database,
or fetch information from the internet. Tools extend what agents can do beyond
just answering questions. Agents discover tools via MCP servers.

**What does Hypermode Agents do?**

Hypermode Agents is a tool that lets you create your own AI agents. You can set
up agents to help with things like answering questions, automating tasks, or
providing expert support—no coding required.

**Is Hypermode Agents just for developers?**

No. Hypermode Agents is designed for everyone, even if you have no coding
background.

**What can we use an AI agent for?**

You can use an AI agent to answer questions, automate repetitive work, reduce
“swivel chair” work, organize information, or assist with daily tasks.

**What if the agent doesn't work as expected?**

You can change your instructions and test again. It is normal to adjust and
improve your agent over time.

**What's a system prompt?**

A system prompt is a set of written instructions that guides the overall agent's
actions and responses. Think of this as defining your agent's personality and
capabilities.

**What about information security?**

Yes. Hypermode takes privacy and security seriously and protects your data.

## Tips for training your agents

- **Give explicit instructions**
  - Example: "Any time you post a message via the Slack tool on behalf of the
    user, prepend your message with: 'Hypermode Agent Mr. Robot:' but only do
    that when you post in Slack. Make sure not to do so when just responding to
    the user."
- **Set clear boundaries**
  - Example: "Only answer questions related to the Hypermode Agents. If asked
    about other products, politely decline."
- **Specify output format**
  - Example: "Respond using numbered steps for instructions, and use bullet
    points for lists."
- **Provide example interactions**
  - Example:
    - User: "How to reset the password?"
    - Agent: "1. Go to the login page. 2. Click 'Forgot Password'. 3. Follow the
      instructions sent to your email."
- **Define tone and style**
  - Example: "Use a friendly and professional tone. Keep responses under 100
    words unless more detail is requested."
- **Anticipate common questions**
  - Example: "If a user asks about pricing, direct them to the pricing page and
    offer to connect them with sales."
- **Tell the agent what not to do**
  - Example: "Don't provide legal or medical advice. Don't make up information
    if you are unsure."
- **Test and revise**
  - After writing your prompt, test it with sample requests. If the agent's
    responses are off-target, revise your instructions to be even more specific.

  "Build AI agents that act, not just chat—from natural conversation to
  production-ready code"
---

Most AI agents today still feel like prototypes. They can generate content,
answer questions, or summarize a PDF. But when it comes to doing real
work—embedding in live apps, reducing back-office load, or following up with
customers—they fall short.

They chat. But they don't act.

**Hypermode Agents are here to change that.** Built on the latest AI advances,
Hypermode Agents are built for work, not just conversation. You'll learn what
agents can do, how they reason, and what their outputs look like, all while
building something useful from day one.

## The complete AI development platform

Built on top of the open source Modus AI Agent Framework and the Hypermode
Platform, Hypermode Agents enables you to get started building domain specific
agents from natural language.

![Hypermode Agents](/images/agents/threads.png)

- **Concierge** is Hypermode's AI-powered agent that transforms natural language
  descriptions into fully functional agents. No coding experience required.
- **Threads** is a conversational interface that lets you build, train, and
  refine AI agents through natural language—no coding required. When you're
  ready, **eject to code** exports your trained agent as a complete Modus app.
- **Connections** enable Hypermode Agents to understand and interact with their
  environment. By leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, Hypermode
  Agents **Hypermode Agents get access to a vast ecosystem of tools and
  integrations by default.**
- **Tasks** are repeatable sets of instructions that you can save and use later
  with your agent. Think of a task as a learned skill for your agent.

### Production-ready from day one

Unlike other platforms that require you to rebuild for production, Hypermode is
designed for real-world use:

- **Serverless infrastructure** that scales automatically and costs nothing when
  idle
- **Full observability** with inference logging, tracing, and debugging tools
- **Enterprise security** with role-based access and audit trails
- **Branch-based environments** for testing and staging
- **Open source foundation** with no vendor lock-in

## From conversation to code

The power of Hypermode is in its flexibility. Domain experts can build
sophisticated agents through conversation, while developers can export those
agents as production-ready code.

**Domain experts** work directly with agents through Threads, shaping behavior
through natural conversation and training agents with real examples.

**Platform teams** can export trained agents as complete Modus applications,
audit and version control the logic, and deploy as production microservices with
full observability.

**No information loss** between business requirements and technical
implementation. **No rebuild required** to go from prototype to production.

## What can you build?

**Sales pipeline agent**: analyzes sales data and manages pipeline activities,
integrating Stripe, HubSpot, and Slack.

**Customer support agent**: analyzes support tickets and provides insights
across email and support platforms.

**Marketing insights agent**: analyzes marketing performance across channels and
provides optimization recommendations.

title: "Train Your Agent With Tasks"
sidebarTitle: "Train Your Agent"
description: "Train your agent based on learned skills"
---

Tasks are a repeatable set of instructions that you can save and use later with
your agent. Think of a task as a learned skill for your agent.

## Create task

Once you've interacted with your agent through a thread and your agent has
completed a specific activity - such as creating a recommended playlist,
updating your calendar, or generating a research report - you can save that
activity as a task by selecting the "Create task" button.

This turns the thread into a repeatable task that you can use later to automate
your agent's workflow.

![Create task](/images/agents/create-task-1.png)

## Use tasks

After saving a task to your agent you'll see the task in your agent's task list.
You can then use the task to automate your agent's workflow.

---

**Threads is where ideas become agents.** it's a conversational interface that
lets you build, train, and refine AI agents through natural language—no coding
required.

![Threads](/images/agents/threads.png)

### General guidance

- **Start simple:** Begin with a basic use case or workflow. Don't try to build
  a complex agent right away—get comfortable with the basics first.
  - You're going to need to learn to speak “agent.” You'll find some phrases are
    obvious to you but very ambiguous to an agent. The more you use Hypermode,
    the more it becomes natural.
- **Define clear goals:** Know what you want your agent to accomplish. Write
  down the specific tasks or problems you want the agent to solve.
  - For example, "goal: update the hero text on the website" then going into the
    rest of your instructions.
- **Understand inputs/outputs:** Learn what information (inputs) your agent
  needs and what kind of results (outputs) to produce.
  - Click to expand the tool calls you see streaming by as your agent works.
    Start to build an intuition around how your agent is executing work.
- **Use step-by-step instructions:** Break down tasks into small, logical steps.
  Agents perform best when instructions are clear and sequential.
- **Use check steps:** Frequently request an agent to check its work and verify
  that specific steps are completed. Today's AI is very eager to please,
  unfortunately that means it lies frequently about tasks being completed. Ask
  it to double check that specific actions have been taken.
