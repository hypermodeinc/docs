## Overview

In this document you will learn how to connect your Hypermode agent to Supabase,
enabling real-time database operations and interactions.

Bwfore getting started you need to make an account with supabase, you can do
that here: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

![Signup](/images//connections/supabase/signup-supabase.png)

Then you need to make a database and go to the settings to make a new API key.

![Create Key](/images/connections/supabase/create-key.png)

This key will become the service key when you connect using Hypermode Agents and
the subdomain will be the projeect id in the URL:

Examples: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/my-project-id/settings/api-keys

Subdomain ID: my-project-id Service Key: --key-from-supabase--

Now you have got all you need setup with supabase we can now make our agent in
hypermode.

Creating your supabase agent.

Firslty ensure you have signed up and created a workspace on
[Hypermode](https://hypermode.com/).

Now frmo the threads interfaces, lets manually create a new agent to streamline
the process.

You can create agets with either conciege or manually, we will do this manually,
from the UI find the create agent dropdown: ]\

![Find Create Agent](/images/connections/supabase/navigate-create-agent.png)

Then select the "Create new Agent" option, this will open a modal to create your
agent:

![Create Agent](/images/connections/supabase/create-agent-modal.png)

To streanline this process we will use the following settings:

Agent Name: SupaAgent Agent Title: Connects to Supabase Description: SupaAgent
issues queries Instructions: You have a connection to Supabase and various other
developer tools to streamline data access and awareness. Model: GPT 4.1

Once created you will see the agent in the sidebar living and breathing ready to
interact with, take yourself to the agents setting page via the agents icon and
see the profile:

![Agent Profile](/images/connections/supabase/agent-profile.png)

Now navgiate to the connections tab, this is where we will add our supabase
connection.

![Dropdown supabase](/images/connections/supabase/add-supabase-connection.png)

This is where we need to add our supabase connection, click the dropdown and
select "Supabase" from the list, then you will be presented with a Modal, from
here we should take the Domain ID and Service Key we created earlier and paste
them into the relevant fields:

![Supabase Connection](/images/connections/supabase/supabase-connection-modal.png)

Great now you Agent is connected to Supabase, you can now use it to issue
queries and interact with your database.

You can learn more about this supabase connector here:
https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/supabase

<Note>
  The supabase connector does not let you modify the schema, for this reason
  lets manually create the schema for interaction.
</Note>

Lets migrate our database with some movie data, to do this we will need to
navigate back to the supabase workspace and find the query editor, this is where
we can run SQL queries to create our schema and insert data, here is the schema
we will work with:

```sql
-- 1. Movies Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public."Movies" (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    year INTEGER
);

-- 2. Actors Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public."Actors" (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- 3. MovieActors Join Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public."MovieActors" (
    movie_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES public."Movies"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    actor_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES public."Actors"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, actor_id)
);
```

![Migrate Supabase](/images/connections/supabase/migrate.png)

![Schema](/images/connections/supabase/supabase-schema.png)

<Note>
  The supabase connector does not let you modify the schema, for this reason
  lets manually create the schema for interaction - you can ask your Agent to
  help you build the schema.
</Note>

Finnaly one last step before our agent can understand our db we need to modify
the system prompt of the agent to include the schema, you can do this by copying
the schema and navigtaing the the agents page pasting in the schema into the
system prompt, this will allow the agent to understand the schema and issue
queries against it.

![Agent update prompt](/images/connections/supabase/agent-update-prompt.png)

Now we are ready to work with our agent and ou supabase database.

Testing the connection, its always best to test the connection first, lets ask
it to fetch a list of Movies, note we will have empty mooives but you are
looking for success tool call in the chat history.

Try asking in a new thread:

```text
Can you list the movies ?
```

You will see the Supabase select row tool call in the chat history, this is a
good sign that the connection is working and the agent can issue queries against
the database.

![Empty movies](/images/connections/supabase/empty-movies.png)

Now we have all we need to start inserting movies and actors in our database.

Adding a movie:

Try asking in a new thread:

```text
Can you Add the Matrix 1999 and Neo the actor into my Supabase database?
```

![Add Movie](/images/connections/supabase/add-matrix.png)

Thats it your connected, try adding more data, scheming a new schema and reading
the data in your instace, finally supabase can be paird well with other
connections such as Gthub and Slack and Stripe.
