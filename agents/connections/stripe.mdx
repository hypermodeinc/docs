## Overview

Stripe is a comprehensive payments platform that handles everything from payment
processing to financial reporting. This guide will walk you through connecting
your Hypermode agent to Stripe, enabling automated payment operations, customer
management, and financial data analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting Stripe to Hypermode, you'll need:

1. A [Stripe account](https://stripe.com/) (individual or business)
2. Stripe API credentials (publishable and secret keys)
3. A [Hypermode workspace](https://hypermode.com/)

## Setting up Stripe

### Create your Stripe account

If you haven't already, sign up for a Stripe account. You can start with a test
account to experiment safely.

### Access your API keys

Navigate to your Stripe dashboard to find your API credentials:

1. Go to **Developers** → **API keys** in your Stripe dashboard
2. You'll see both test and live API keys
3. Start with test keys for development

![Stripe API keys](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-api-keys-dashboard.png)

<Note>
  Stripe provides separate test and live environments. Always start with test
  keys during development to avoid processing real payments accidentally.
</Note>

### Create a restricted API token (Recommended)

For enhanced security, create a restricted API token with only the permissions
your agent needs:

1. Go to **Developers** → **API keys**
2. Click **Create restricted key**
3. Select specific permissions based on your use case

![Create restricted key](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-restricted-key.png)

**Recommended permissions for most agents:**

- **Customers**: Read and Write
- **Payment Intents**: Read and Write
- **Charges**: Read
- **Invoices**: Read and Write
- **Products**: Read and Write
- **Subscriptions**: Read and Write

<Warning>
  Only grant the minimum permissions your agent actually needs. This follows the
  principle of least privilege and enhances security.
</Warning>

## Creating your Stripe agent

### Create a new agent

From the Hypermode interface, create a new agent manually:

1. Click the agent dropdown menu
2. Select "Create new Agent"

### Configure agent settings

Use these recommended settings for your Stripe agent:

- **Agent Name**: StripeSleuth
- **Agent Title**: Connects to Stripe Payments
- **Description**: StripeSleuth handles payment processing and customer
  management
- **Instructions**: You have a connection to Stripe and various other developer
  tools to streamline payment operations, customer management, and financial
  reporting. You can process payments, manage subscriptions, handle refunds, and
  analyze financial data.
- **Model**: GPT-4.1

## Connecting to Stripe

### Add the Stripe connection

Select the Agents tab in the left navigation bar, then click your StripeSleuth
agent. Select the "Connections" tab.

1. Click "Add connection"
2. Select "Stripe" from the dropdown

![Add Stripe connection](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-add-connection.png)

### Configure credentials

Enter your Stripe credentials:

- **API Key**: Your Stripe secret key (starts with `sk_test_` for test mode or
  `sk_live_` for live mode)

![Stripe connection modal](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-configure-connection.png)

<Warning>
  Keep your secret API key secure! This key provides full access to your Stripe
  account and should never be exposed in client-side code or shared publicly.

We recommend using a Stripe Sandbox environment for development and testing.

</Warning>

## Verifying the Stripe connection

### Test basic connectivity

Start a new thread and test the connection with a simple query:

```text
Can you check my Stripe account balance?
```

You should see a Stripe tool call in the chat history, confirming the connection
works:

![Test connection](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-test-connection.png)

### Test permissions

Verify your API key has the necessary permissions:

```text
Can you list my recent customers and products?
```

If you see permission errors, you may need to update your API key permissions or
use a different key.

## Setting up your Stripe environment

<Note>
  Unlike databases, Stripe doesn't require schema setup. However, you'll want to
  configure products, pricing, and webhook endpoints for a complete integration.
</Note>

### Create test products

Set up some test products to work with:

```text
Can you create a test product called "Premium Subscription" with a monthly price of $29.99?
```

### Update agent instructions

Enhance your agent's understanding by updating its instructions with your
business context:

```text
You are connected to a Stripe account for [Your Business Name]. Our main products include:

1. **Premium Subscription** - $29.99/month recurring
2. **Basic Plan** - $9.99/month recurring
3. **One-time Setup** - $99 one-time payment

When processing payments, always:
- Verify customer information
- Use appropriate product IDs
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide clear confirmation messages

For subscription management, monitor for failed payments and proactively communicate with customers about billing issues.
```

## Testing payment operations

### Test 1: Create a customer

Test customer creation capability:

```text
Can you create a new customer with email bob.loblaw@example.com and name "Bob Loblaw"?
```

![Create customer](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-create-customer.png)

### Test 2: Process a test payment

Try processing a payment using Stripe's test card numbers:

```text
Can you create a payment intent for $50 for customer bob.loblaw@example.com?
```

<Note>
  In test mode, use Stripe's test card numbers like `4242424242424242` for
  successful payments or `4000000000000002` for declined cards.
</Note>

### Test 3: Handle subscriptions

Test subscription management:

```text
Can you create a monthly subscription for Bob Loblaw using the Premium Subscription product?
```

![Create subscription](/images/connections/stripe/stripe-create-subscription.png)

## What you can do

With your Stripe connection established, your agent can:

- **Process payments** with various payment methods
- **Manage customers** and their payment information
- **Handle subscriptions** including creation, updates, and cancellations
- **Process refunds** and handle disputes
- **Generate invoices** and manage billing
- **Analyze financial data** and generate reports
- **Manage products and pricing** dynamically
- **Integrate with other tools** like CRM systems, email marketing, and
  accounting software

## Best practices

1. **Security first**: Always use restricted API keys with minimal required
   permissions
2. **Test thoroughly**: Use Stripe's test environment before going live
3. **Error handling**: Implement robust error handling for payment failures
4. **Compliance**: Ensure PCI compliance and follow data protection regulations
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for failed payments and unusual activity

## Advanced operations

### Payment processing workflows

Your agent can handle complex payment scenarios:

```text
Process a payment for a customer, and if it fails, try their backup payment method, then send them an email notification
```

### Subscription management

Automate subscription lifecycle management:

```text
Check for subscriptions that failed payment in the last 24 hours and send dunning emails to those customers
```

### Financial reporting

Generate comprehensive financial reports:

```text
Create a monthly revenue report showing breakdown by product, including refunds and net revenue
```

### Dispute handling

Manage chargebacks and disputes:

```text
List all open disputes and provide evidence suggestions for each case
```

## Integration examples

### E-commerce automation

```text
When a customer places an order, create a payment intent, and if successful, fulfill the order and send a confirmation email
```

### SaaS billing management

```text
Monitor subscription statuses and automatically downgrade accounts when payments fail after the grace period
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common connection issues

1. **Invalid API key**: Verify your key is correct and has proper permissions
2. **Test vs Live mode**: Ensure your API key matches the intended environment
3. **Rate limiting**: Stripe has rate limits; your agent will handle these
   automatically
4. **Insufficient permissions**: Update your restricted key permissions as
   needed

### Payment failures

1. **Declined cards**: Use appropriate test card numbers in test mode
2. **Authentication required**: Handle 3D Secure authentication flows
3. **Insufficient funds**: Test with appropriate test card numbers
4. **Invalid parameters**: Verify all required fields are provided correctly

### Webhook issues

1. **Endpoint verification**: Ensure your webhook endpoint is accessible
2. **Event handling**: Verify you're listening for the correct event types
3. **Signature verification**: Implement proper webhook signature verification

## Security considerations

<Warning>
  Never expose your Stripe secret keys in client-side code, logs, or public
  repositories. Always use environment variables or secure key management
  systems.
</Warning>

1. **API key rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys
2. **Webhook signatures**: Always verify webhook signatures to ensure
   authenticity
3. **PCI compliance**: Follow PCI requirements when handling card data
4. **Audit logs**: Monitor your Stripe dashboard for unusual activity
5. **Two-factor authentication**: Enable 2FA on your Stripe account
