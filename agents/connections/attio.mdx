## Overview

Attio is a modern, highly customizable CRM platform that helps businesses manage
customer relationships, track deals, and organize data in a flexible way. This
guide will walk you through connecting your Hypermode agent to Attio for
automated CRM operations.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting Attio to Hypermode, you'll need:

1. An [Attio workspace](https://attio.com/)
2. Admin permissions to generate API credentials
3. A [Hypermode workspace](https://hypermode.com/)

## Getting started with Attio

### Step 1: Sign up for Attio

If you don't have an Attio account yet, you'll need to create one first. Visit
the Attio homepage to get started:

![Attio Homepage](/images/connections/attio/homepage.png)

Click "Sign up" to create your new Attio workspace. You'll need admin access to
generate the API credentials required for the Hypermode integration.

### Step 2: Note your workspace domain

Your Attio workspace URL will be in the format
`https://[workspace-name].attio.com`. Make note of your workspace name as you'll
authenticate through Attio when adding the connection to Hypermode.

## Creating your Attio agent

### Step 1: Create a new agent

From the Hypermode interface, create a new agent:

1. Click the agent dropdown menu
2. Select "Create new Agent"

![Navigate to create agent](/images/connections/attio/navigate-create-agent.png)

### Step 2: Configure agent settings

Use these recommended settings for your Attio CRM agent:

- **Agent Name**: CRMAgent
- **Agent Title**: Attio CRM Manager
- **Description**: Manages customer relationships and deal tracking in Attio CRM
- **Instructions**: You have a connection to Attio CRM. You can create and
  update companies and deals, search for existing records, manage deal
  pipelines, and track customer interactions. Always confirm data before making
  changes and provide clear summaries of actions taken.
- **Model**: GPT-4.1 - Default - Optionally, use Claude for best results

### Step 3: View your agent profile

Once created, navigate to your agent's settings page:

![Agent profile](/images/connections/attio/agent-profile.png)

## Connecting to Attio

### Step 1: Add the Attio connection

Navigate to the **Connections** tab and add Attio:

1. Click "Add connection"
2. Search for "Attio" in the available connections

### Step 2: Configure connection with OAuth

When you select Attio, you'll be prompted to authenticate via OAuth. This will
redirect you to Attio's authorization page:

![Attio App Request](/images/connections/attio/attio-app-request.png)

Follow the OAuth flow to grant Hypermode access to your Attio workspace. This
secure process ensures your credentials are never directly stored in Hypermode.

<Note>
  The OAuth flow ensures secure authentication without exposing your API
  credentials. You'll be redirected back to Hypermode once authorization is
  complete.
</Note>

## Understanding Attio's data model

Attio uses a flexible data model that includes:

- **Companies**: Organizations and account details
- **Deals**: Sales opportunities and their progress through pipelines
- **Custom Objects**: Any custom data types you've created
- **Lists**: Collections of records with shared characteristics
- **Attributes**: Custom fields that can be added to any object type

This flexibility makes Attio perfect for:

- Complex sales pipeline management
- Detailed customer relationship tracking
- Custom workflow automation
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Testing the connection

### Test 1: Search for existing companies

Start a new thread with your agent and test the connection:

```text
Can you show me the first 10 companies in our Attio CRM?
```

![Search companies result](/images/connections/attio/first-companies.png)

### Test 2: Create a new company

Try adding a new company to your CRM:

```text
Introspect the workspace and create a new company in Attio with the following details:

Name: Tech Solutions Inc
Website (domain): techsolutions.com
Industry/Category: Software
Employee Range: 50-100
Description: A leading provider of innovative tech solutions.
Primary Location: San Francisco, CA
```

![Create company](/images/connections/attio/create-company.png)

### Test 3: Create and manage a deal

Create a sales opportunity and track its progress:

```text
Create a new deal in Attio:
- Deal name: "Q1 Enterprise Software License"
- Company: Tech Solutions Inc
- Value: $50,000
- Stage: Discovery
```

![Create deal](/images/connections/attio/create-deal.png)

### Test 4: Update deal status

Move the deal through your pipeline:

```text
Add a note about the "Enterprise Software License - TechCorp" deal that the demo completed yesterday.
```

![Add note](/images/connections/attio/add-note.png)

## What you can do

With your Attio connection established, your agent can:

- **Manage companies**: Create, update, and search for organizations and account
  details
- **Track deals**: Create opportunities, update pipeline stages, and manage deal
  values
- **Organize data**: Use lists and custom attributes to categorize records
- **Search and filter**: Find records based on various criteria
- **Generate reports**: Analyze pipeline health and company data
- **Integrate workflows**: Combine CRM operations with other tools like email,
  calendar, and project management

<Note>
  The Attio connection provides access to a comprehensive set of tools for CRM
  management focused on companies and deals. The available tools may vary as we
  optimize the connection for the most commonly used operations.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

#### OAuth authentication failed

- Ensure you have admin permissions in your Attio workspace
- Try clearing your browser cache and cookies
- Make sure you're logged into the correct Attio workspace during OAuth flow

#### "Workspace not found" error

- Confirm you completed the OAuth flow successfully
