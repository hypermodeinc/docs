## Overview

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document database that provides flexible schema
design and powerful querying capabilities. This guide will walk you through
connecting your Hypermode agent to MongoDB, enabling seamless document
operations and data management for your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting MongoDB to Hypermode, you'll need:

1. A [MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or local
   MongoDB installation
2. A MongoDB database with connection credentials
3. A [Hypermode workspace](https://hypermode.com/)

## Setting up MongoDB

### Step 1: Create your MongoDB Atlas account

If you haven't already, sign up for a
[free MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to get started
with cloud-hosted MongoDB.

### Step 2: Create a cluster and database

1. Create a new cluster in MongoDB Atlas
2. Set up database access credentials
3. Configure network access (whitelist IP addresses)
4. Create your first database and collection

Check the box to load sample data. This will create a movies database with
sample data in several collections.

You'll also need to create a user and password for your database.

![Create MongoDB user](/images/connections/mongodb/create-user.png)

### Step 3: Generate connection string

Navigate to your cluster and get the connection string:

1. Click "Connect" on your cluster
2. Choose "Connect"
3. Copy the connection string and replace `<password>` with your database user
   password. You'll use this connection string to connect your Hypermode agent
   to MongoDB.

![MongoDB connection string](/images/connections/mongodb/connection-string.png)

<Note>
  Your connection string will look like:
  `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
</Note>

### Step 4: Whitelist IP addresses

Navigate to your cluster and whitelist IP addresses to allow connections from
your Hypermode agent:

1. Click "Network Access" on your cluster
2. Add the IP address range `0.0.0.0/0` to allow connections from any IP address

## Creating your MongoDB agent

### Step 1: Create a new agent

From the Hypermode interface, create a new agent manually:

1. Click the agent dropdown menu
2. Select "Create new Agent"

### Step 2: Configure agent settings

Use these recommended settings for your MongoDB agent:

- **Agent Name**: MongoAgent
- **Agent Title**: Connects to MongoDB
- **Description**: MongoAgent manages document operations
- **Instructions**: You have a connection to MongoDB and various other developer
  tools to streamline document data access and management. You can perform CRUD
  operations, aggregations, and complex queries on MongoDB collections.
- **Model**: GPT-4.1

## Connecting to MongoDB

### Step 1: Add the MongoDB connection

Navigate to the **Connections** tab and add MongoDB:

1. Click "Add connection"
2. Select "MongoDB" from the dropdown

![Add MongoDB connection](/images/connections/mongodb/add-mongodb-connection.png)

### Step 2: Configure credentials

Enter your MongoDB credentials:

- **Username**: The username of your MongoDB user
- **Password**: The password of your MongoDB user
- **Database Name**: The default database to connect to
- **Hostname**: The hostname of your MongoDB cluster. This is the part of your
  MongoDB connection string that comes after `mongodb+srv://` and is a domain
  name. For example given the connection string
  `mongodb+srv://will:<db_password>@hypermodeturorials.o7ygcmn.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=HypermodeTurorials`,
  the hostname is `hypermodeturorials.o7ygcmn.mongodb.net`

<Warning>
  Keep your connection string secure! This contains your database credentials
  and should never be exposed in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Testing the connection

Your agent can create collections, add documents, and perform queries on your
MongoDB database. Since we created a sample movies database, let's test it out
using the sample data in MongoDB.

### Test 1: Query empty collections

Start a new thread and test with a simple query:

```text
Can you show me all movies in the database?
```

You should see a MongoDB tool call in the chat history, confirming the
connection works:

![Empty movies query](/images/connections/mongodb/empty-movies.png)

### Test 2: Insert documents

Now try adding data to your database:

```text
Can you add The Matrix from 1999 directed by the Wachowskis to my MongoDB database?
```

![Add Matrix movie](/images/connections/mongodb/add-matrix.png)

### Test 3: Complex queries

Test more advanced operations:

```text
Can you find all movies from the 1910s and show their average rating?
```

![Complex query](/images/connections/mongodb/complex-query.png)

## What you can do

With your MongoDB connection established, your agent can:

- **Query documents** with complex filters and projections
- **Insert, update, and delete** documents
- **Perform aggregations** for data analysis and reporting
- **Work with embedded documents** and arrays
- **Execute transactions** for multi-document operations
- **Create indexes** for improved query performance
- **Integrate with other tools** like GitHub, Slack, and Stripe

## Best practices

1. **Schema design**: Design your document structure to match your query
   patterns
2. **Indexing**: Create indexes on frequently queried fields
3. **Connection management**: Use connection pooling for better performance
4. **Error handling**: Your agent will handle common database errors gracefully
5. **Data validation**: Consider using MongoDB schema validation for data
   consistency

## Advanced operations

### Aggregation pipelines

Your agent can perform complex aggregation operations:

```text
Can you group movies by decade and show the count and average rating for each decade?
```

### Text search

Enable text search on your collections:

```text
Can you find all movies that mention "robot" in their title or description?
```

### Geospatial queries

For location-based data:

```text
Find all movie theaters within 10 miles of coordinates [40.7128, -74.0060]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common connection issues

1. **Network access**: Ensure your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
2. **Authentication**: Verify your username and password are correct
3. **Connection string**: Check that your connection string format is valid
4. **Database permissions**: Ensure your user has appropriate read/write
   permissions

### Performance optimization

1. **Query optimization**: Use explain() to analyze query performance
2. **Index usage**: Monitor index usage and create appropriate indexes
3. **Document size**: Keep documents reasonably sized for better performance
4. **Connection pooling**: Configure appropriate connection pool settings

<Tip>
  Combine MongoDB with other Hypermode connections to build powerful workflows.
  For example, use GitHub to track code changes that affect your data models, or
  Slack to notify your team of important database updates and analytics
  insights.
