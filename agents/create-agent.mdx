Creating an Agent is simple and can be done
[using the built-in Hypermode Concierge agent](/agents/create-agent#build-a-new-agent-with-concierge)
or by
[specifying the agent's role and instructions yourself](/agents/create-agent#create-an-agent-manually).

## Build a new agent with Concierge

![Hypermode Concierge agent](/images/agents/concierge.png)

**Concierge** is Hypermode's AI-powered agent that transforms natural language
descriptions into fully functional agents. No coding experience required.

### Overview

Concierge streamlines agent creation by converting your requirements into
structured, working agent scaffolds through a guided process that takes just
minutes to complete.

<Steps>

<Step title="Start a new thread with Concierge">

Select the "Start a new thread" option from the left navigation bar under the
Hypermode Concierge agent.

</Step>

<Step title="Describe your agent requirements">

The Concierge agent asks some basic questions about what kind of agent you'd
like to create and the tasks you'd like the agent to take on your behalf.

</Step>

<Step title="Refine your agent description">

Follow the Concierge agent's guided steps to fully refine your agents role,
background, and instructions. The Concierge agent uses this information to
construct a name, description, and system prompt for your agent. Once you've
fully specified the details, your new agent is created and added to the left
navigation bar alongside the other agents in your workspace.

<Tip>
  Traditional hand-written prompts often suffer from inconsistency, verbosity,
  or vagueness. Concierge solves this by using AI to author structured prompts
  that follow best practices for models.

<Step title="Enable connections and start working with your agent">

To take actions on your behalf, such as updating your calendar or submitting
code updates as pull requests, your agent needs access to connections with
services to act on your behalf. Which connections you enable for your agent
depends on the type and scope of agent to be created. For example, our product
marketing agent might need access to GitHub to be able to submit website changes
as pull requests and access to Notion to read internal messaging and product
documents.

Once you've added connections, start chatting with your agent by asking what
they can help you with or what connections they have access to.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Create an agent manually

Agents can also be created manually by following the steps below.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create new agent">

Select the "Create new agent" option from the left navigation bar.

</Step>

<Step title="Describe your agent">

Choose a name, title, and description for your agent. An agent avatar is
generated randomly but you can also upload your own avatar.

  alt="Describe your agent"
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "400px" }}
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Add your agent instructions">

The agent instructions are the system prompt that's used to guide the agent's
behavior. This is where you define the agent's role and objectives.

  alt="Add your agent instructions"
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "400px" }}
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Select your agent's model">

Select the model that you want to use for your agent. The model is used to run
the agent's instructions, including choosing how to leverage tools.

  alt="Select your agent's model"
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "400px" }}
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Enable connections and start working with your agent">

Enable connections to allow your agent to access tools and data. This is where
you define the tools that your agent has access to.
