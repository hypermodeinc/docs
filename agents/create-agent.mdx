Creating an Agent is simple and can be done
[using the built-in Hypermode Agent Helper concierge agent](/agents/create-agent#build-a-new-agent-with-concierge)
or by
[specifying the agent's role and instructions yourself](/agents/create-agent#create-an-agent-manually).

## Build a new agent with Concierge

**Hypermode Agent Helper Concierge** is Hypermode's AI-powered agent that
transforms natural language descriptions into fully functional agents. No coding
experience required.

### Overview

Concierge streamlines agent creation by converting your requirements into
structured, working agent scaffolds through a guided process that takes just
minutes to complete.

<Steps>

<Step title="Start a new thread with Hypermode Agent Helper Concierge">

To get started with the Agent Helper Concierge, select the "Create new" option
to create a new thread and select the "Hypermode Agent Helper" helper.

</Step>

<Step title="Describe your agent requirements">

The Concierge agent asks some basic questions about what kind of agent you'd
like to create and the tasks you'd like the agent to take on your behalf.

</Step>

<Step title="Refine your agent description">

Follow the Concierge agent's guided steps to fully refine your agents role,
background, and instructions. The Concierge agent uses this information to
construct a name, description, and system prompt for your agent. Once you've
fully specified the details, your new agent is created and added to the left
navigation bar alongside the other agents in your workspace.

<Tip>
  Traditional hand-written prompts often suffer from inconsistency, verbosity,
  or vagueness. Concierge solves this by using AI to author structured prompts
  that follow best practices for models.

<Step title="Enable connections and start working with your agent">

To take actions on your behalf, such as updating your calendar or submitting
code updates as pull requests, your agent needs access to connections with
services to act on your behalf. Which connections you enable for your agent
depends on the type and scope of agent to be created. For example, our product
marketing agent might need access to GitHub to be able to submit website changes
as pull requests and access to Notion to read internal messaging and product
documents.

Select the Agents view from the left navigation bar. Here you'll see the list of
all agents in your workspace. Select "Add connections" next to the agent you
just created.

![Enable connections and start working with your agent](/images/agents/manual-create-connections.png)

To add a connection select it from the list of available connections or search
for it in the search bar.

![Enable connections and start working with your agent](/images/agents/manual-create-connections-github.png)

After selecting a connection, you'll be prompted to complete the OAuth flow to
authorize the agent to access the connection on your behalf.

Once you've added connections, we're ready to start working with your agent.

</Step>

</Steps>

![Describe your agent](/images/agents/manual-create-form.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Add your agent instructions">

The agent instructions are the system prompt that's used to guide the agent's
behavior. This is where you define the agent's role and objectives.

![Add your agent instructions](/images/agents/manual-create-3.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Select your agent's model">

Select the model that you want to use for your agent. The model is used to run
the agent's instructions, including choosing how to leverage tools.

</Step>

<Step title="Enable connections and start working with your agent">
Connections enable the agent to understand and act on its environment. Add the connections that your agent will need to perform its tasks.

Select the Agents view from the left navigation bar. Here you'll see the list of
all agents in your workspace. Select "Add connections" next to the agent you
just created.

![Enable connections and start working with your agent](/images/agents/manual-create-connections.png)

To add a connection select it from the list of available connections or search
for it in the search bar.

![Enable connections and start working with your agent](/images/agents/manual-create-connections-github.png)

After selecting a connection, you'll be prompted to complete the OAuth flow to
authorize the agent to access the connection on your behalf.

Once you've added connections, we're ready to start working with your agent.
