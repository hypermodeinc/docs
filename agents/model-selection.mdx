## Model selection process

Follow this step-by-step process to choose the right model for your specific
needs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Your Agent's Primary Function">
    Start by clearly defining what your agent does most often:
    - **Analyze and reason** (research, complex decisions)
    - **Create content** (writing, marketing, creative work)
    - **Process data** (spreadsheets, databases, routine operations)
    - **Interact with users** (support, scheduling, real-time chat)
    - **Work with code** (development, reviews, technical tasks)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Estimate Your Volume and Budget">
    Consider how often your agent is used:
    - **High volume** (1000+ interactions/day): choose efficient models like `GPT-4o-mini`
    - **Medium volume** (100-1000/day): balanced models like `GPT-4o` work well
    - **Low volume** (less than 100/day): any model based on complexity needs

    **Budget considerations:** premium models cost more but deliver better results for complex tasks

  </Step>

<Step title="Assess Task Complexity">
  Match your complexity needs to model capabilities: - **Simple, routine
  tasks**: mini/Flash variants for cost efficiency - **Moderate complexity**:
  standard models like `GPT-4o`, `Claude-3-5-sonnet-latest` - **Complex
  reasoning**: advanced models like `o3`, `Claude-opus-4-20250514`
</Step>

<Step title="Consider Performance Requirements">
  Determine what matters most for your use case: - **Speed critical**: fast
  models like `GPT-4o-mini`, `Gemini-1.5-flash-latest` - **Accuracy critical**:
  premium models like `o3`, `Claude-opus-4-20250514` - **Balanced needs**:
  mid-tier models like `GPT-4o`, `Claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`
</Step>

  <Step title="Test and Optimize">
    Start with the recommended model, then optimize:
    - Test with real examples from your use case
    - Monitor cost and performance metrics
    - Adjust based on actual usage patterns
    - Consider dynamic routing for optimal cost-performance balance
  </Step>
</Steps>
