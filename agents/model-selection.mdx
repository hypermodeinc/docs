## Optimization strategy

### 1. Start with capability

Begin with **GPT-4.1** to understand what's possible. Focus on proving value and
refining your agent's role before worrying about cost optimization.

### 2. Measure and learn

Track these key metrics as you use your agent:

- Task completion quality

- Frequency of use
- Business impact

### 3. Optimize when ready

Once you understand your agent's value and usage patterns:

- **High volume + simple tasks** → Try GPT-4o Mini
- **Creative work focus** → Test Claude 4 Opus
- **Complex analysis needs** → Explore O3

### 4. Mix and match

Advanced users can route different types of requests to different models:

- Routine tasks → GPT-4o Mini
- Creative work → Claude 4 Opus
- Analysis → GPT-4.1 or O3

## Getting started

1. **Create your agent** with GPT-4.1 (the default)
2. **Focus on instructions and connections** to define your agent's role
3. **Test with real examples** from your workflow
4. **Refine and iterate** based on results
5. **Consider alternatives** once you understand value and patterns

<Tip>
  **Value first, optimization second.** GPT-4.1 handles 90% of business use
  cases effectively. Prove your agent's value before optimizing for cost or
  specialized capabilities.
</Tip>
