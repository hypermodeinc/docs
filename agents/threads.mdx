  "Build, train, and iterate on AI agents through natural conversation—then
  deploy to production-ready code"
---

**Threads is where ideas become agents.** it's a conversational interface that
lets you build, train, and refine AI agents through natural language—no coding
required. When you're ready, deploy your agent as production-ready code.

Unlike traditional chat interfaces that forget everything when you close the
tab, Threads creates **persistent, purpose-built agents** that remember their
training and can be deployed as real software.

## Why threads matters

Most AI agent development follows a painful pattern:

1. **Business expert** describes what they need
2. **Developer** interprets and codes a solution
3. **Back-and-forth** to get it right
4. **Weeks later**, maybe you have what you wanted

**Threads eliminates this translation loss.** Domain experts work directly with
agents, training them through conversation, seeing immediate results, and
iterating in real-time. When ready, **eject to code** exports your trained agent
as a complete Modus app.

```text
Traditional: Idea → Requirements → Code → Deploy → Test → Repeat
Threads:     Idea → Conversation → Working Agent → Eject to Code
```

## Core concepts

### Agents, not chats

Every conversation in Threads is building toward a **reusable agent**. Unlike
ChatGPT where conversations disappear, your Threads interactions create agents
that can:

- Remember their training across sessions
- Be deployed as production code through Hypermode's infrastructure
- Work with your specific tools and data through Connections
- Handle complex, multi-step workflows

### Tools, not just text

Agents in Threads don't just chat—they **act**. Through Connections, your agents
can:

- Access your Slack channels and manage team communications
- Create Linear issues when bugs are found
- Query GitHub repositories and analyze pull requests
- Check your Vercel deployments and build logs
- Search the web for up-to-date information
- Integrate with custom tools through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

### Natural language to deployable code

Everything you build in Threads can be **exported as real software**:

- Your agent's personality and instructions
- The tools it has access to
- Its conversation patterns and responses
- Complete Modus apps through **eject to code**

## Getting started: your first agent

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/images/threads/agent-card.png"
    alt="Your First Agent"
    style={{
      width: "60%",
      maxWidth: "60%",
      height: "auto",
      display: "block",
      margin: "0 auto",
    }}
  />
</div>

Let's build a **Code Review Agent** that helps catch bugs and suggest
improvements. This example shows how Threads transforms a simple idea into a
working agent.

### Step 1: Start with intent

![Your First Thread](/images/threads/minimal-chat.png)

```text
You: "I need an agent that reviews pull requests, checks for security issues,
     and suggests better variable names"

Hypermode Concierge: "I'll help you build a Code Review Agent. Let me set up the basic
                      structure and tools..."
```

The Hypermode Concierge (Hypermode's agent-building agent) scaffolds your new
agent with:

- A focused system prompt
- Access to GitHub tools through Connections
- Code analysis capabilities
- Customized instructions for your workflow

### Step 2: Train through conversation

Through iterative dialogue, you refine your agent's behavior in real-time—each
exchange teaches it to better understand your specific requirements and workflow
preferences.

![Train through conversation](/images/threads/training-chat.png)

```text
You: "Here's a PR with a potential SQL injection vulnerability"
[Pastes code snippet]

Agent: *Analyzes code using GitHub tools*
"I found a SQL injection risk on line 23. The user input isn't sanitized
before being passed to the query. I'd recommend using parameterized queries."

You: "Good catch! But also check variable naming conventions"

Agent: *Updates behavior based on your feedback*
"You're right. I also notice variables like 'data1' and 'temp_thing'
should be more descriptive. I'll include naming suggestions in future reviews."

You: "Perfect. Now I want to deploy this agent"
```

### Step 3: Deploy to production

When your agent works exactly how you want:

![Deploy agent through conversation](/images/threads/deploy-chat.png)

```text
You: "I want to deploy this agent to handle our GitHub PRs automatically"

Threads: *Agent is now available for deployment through Hypermode*
- Agent configuration and prompts saved
- Tool integrations and permissions configured
- Ready for deployment
- Accessible through Hypermode's infrastructure
```

Your conversation just became a **deployable agent**.

### Step 4: Iterate and enhance

Your agent is working, but now you want to streamline your team's workflow.
Through continued conversation, you can enhance your agent's capabilities in
real-time.

![Iterate and enhance](/images/threads/training-chat-2.png)

```text
You: "When you find issues in PRs, can you create Linear tickets automatically?
     That would save us a lot of manual work."

Agent: "Absolutely! I can integrate with Linear to create tickets for issues I find.
        I'll need access to your Linear workspace. What priority should I set for
        security issues vs. code quality issues?"

You: "Security issues should be High priority, code quality Medium.
     Tag them with 'code-review-bot' so we know the source."

Agent: "Perfect! I'm now connecting to Linear and updating my workflow:
        • Security vulnerabilities → High priority Linear tickets
        • Code quality issues → Medium priority tickets
        • All tickets tagged with 'code-review-bot'
        Ready to test! Try submitting a PR with issues."
```

Now your agent has evolved into a **fully automated workflow** that not only
reviews code but takes action on what it finds:

![Enhanced workflow](/images/threads/workflow-diagram.png)

**Your enhanced agent now**:

- Analyzes every new pull request automatically
- Detects security vulnerabilities and code quality issues
- Creates prioritized Linear tickets with appropriate tags
- Comments on PRs with detailed feedback and ticket links
- Maintains context about your team's priorities and conventions

**What changed**: through a simple 3-message conversation, your agent learned to
integrate with Linear, understand your priority system, and automate ticket
creation. No configuration files, no API documentation—just natural language
instruction.

**The result**: your team's code review process is now fully automated, from
detection to ticket creation, saving hours of manual work while ensuring nothing
falls through the cracks.

## Advanced patterns

### Agent specialization

Agents can be built for specific domains with tailored tool access:

```text
GitHub Agent → Specialized for code review and repository management
     ↓
Slack Agent → Focused on team communication and coordination
     ↓
Vercel Agent → Optimized for deployment analysis and infrastructure
```

Each agent excels in its domain while maintaining consistent behavior patterns.

### Task automation

Turn any conversation into automated workflows:

```text
You: "Create a task that analyzes our weekly GitHub activity"

Threads: *Generates structured task definition*
- Captures conversation context
- Defines repeatable workflow
- Maintains agent configuration
```

### Context persistence

Agents remember training across sessions:

```text
Agent: "Based on our previous conversations, I remember you prefer detailed
        code reviews with security focus. Should I continue with that approach?"

You: "Yes, but also add performance considerations"

Agent: "I'll update my review criteria to include performance analysis
        alongside security and code quality."
```

## Model flexibility

Threads works with **multiple models** through Hypermode's Model Router:

- **Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4.1**: Latest OpenAI model for complex
  reasoning and code analysis
- **Claude 4**: Anthropic's advanced model for writing and analysis tasks
- **Gemini**: Google's model for multi-modal tasks and data processing
- **O1/O3**: OpenAI's reasoning models for complex problem-solving
- **Open source models**: Llama, Mistral, and other community models

Switch models to optimize for different tasks:

```text
You: "Use Claude for the writing tasks and GPT-4.1 for code analysis"

Agent: *Adapts model usage based on task type*
"I'm now using Claude for documentation and GPT-4.1 for technical analysis.
The combination provides better results for both areas."
```

## Security and governance

### Tool access control

Agents only get the tools they need:

- **GitHub Agent**: Repository access only (no deployment permissions)
- **Slack Agent**: Communication tools only (no code access)
- **Vercel Agent**: Deployment analysis only (no user data access)

### Team collaboration

- **Domain experts** build and train agents through conversation
- **Platform teams** manage deployment and infrastructure
- **Security teams** audit tool permissions and data access

### Full observability

Every agent action is traceable:

- Tool calls and responses logged
- Message history preserved
- Agent behavior patterns tracked
- Performance metrics collected

## Best practices

### Start specific

```text
❌ "Build me a general assistant"
✅ "Build an agent that analyzes our GitHub PRs and creates Linear issues for bugs"
```

### Train iteratively

```text
❌ "Here's a 500-line requirements document"
✅ "Let's start with basic PR reviews and add complexity through conversation"
```

### Deploy early

```text
❌ "Perfect every detail before deploying"
✅ "Deploy working versions and iterate based on real usage"
```

### Document context

```text
❌ "Figure out what I mean"
✅ "When I say 'urgent', treat it as high priority and notify the team lead"
```
