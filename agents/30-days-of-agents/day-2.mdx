<Card title="Day 2 challenge" icon="calendar">
  **Goal**: show value with real productivity tasks

**Theme**: foundation week - agent productivity in action

**Time investment**: ~10 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 2! Yesterday you explored Sidekick's interface and search
capabilities. Today you'll get Sidekick to work on real productivity
tasks—researching contacts for meetings, connecting your Google Calendar, and
experiencing how agents handle actual work scenarios.

Building on yesterday's foundation, you'll see how agent capabilities translate
into immediate productivity gains.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Research a contact for an upcoming meeting
- Connect your Google Calendar
- Create a calendar event through conversation
- Experience how agents think and respond to real work tasks

<Warning>
  This builds on yesterday's introduction. You'll now see Sidekick in action
  with real productivity scenarios, not just exploration.
</Warning>

## Step 1: research your contact

Let's start with a classic scenario: you have a meeting with someone, and you
want to be prepared. We'll use Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, as our example.

**Start a new conversation with Sidekick** and try this prompt:

```text
I am meeting with Sam Altman from OpenAI tomorrow.
Can you research him and prepare some notes for me?
```

![Sidekick Research - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day2-research.png)

Watch how Sidekick:

- Searches for current information about Sam Altman (building on yesterday's web
  search learning)
- Organizes findings into actionable meeting notes
- Provides context that's actually useful for conversation
- Includes recent developments and OpenAI updates

<Tip>
  **Agent learning moment**: notice how Sidekick structures information for
  practical use, not just information dump. This is the difference between
  search and intelligence.
</Tip>

## Step 2: connect Google calendar

Now let's connect your Google Calendar so Sidekick can manage your schedule.

1. **Add the Google Calendar connection** from the connections panel
2. **Complete the OAuth flow** when prompted
3. **Confirm connection** in your workspace settings

<Info>
  Google Calendar is already configured in Sidekick. Want access to 2,000+ more
  connections? [Upgrade to Hypermode Pro](/agents/connections).
</Info>

## Step 3: create your meeting

With your calendar connected, let's schedule that meeting with Sam Altman:

```text
Create an event tomorrow at 2pm PT for my meeting with Sam Altman.
Title it "Meeting with Sam Altman - OpenAI Discussion" and add the research notes you prepared as the description.
Since we don't have Sam's actual email, please use [YOUR_EMAIL_HERE] as a placeholder for the attendee.
```

![Calendar Event Creation - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day2-create-event.png)

Sidekick:

- Creates the calendar event at the specified time
- Includes your research notes in the description
- Confirms the meeting details

## What just happened?

Building on yesterday's exploration, you've now experienced practical agent
productivity:

**Applied intelligence** - Sidekick didn't just search—it prepared actionable
meeting notes with current information about Sam Altman and OpenAI

**Real integration** - Connected to your actual tools (Google Calendar)

**Seamless action** - Created the calendar event with research included, not
just provide suggestions

**Natural workflow** - All through conversation, no forms or complex interfaces

**Current information** - Used web search (from yesterday's learning) to get the
latest information about your contact

## The power of integrated workflow

Unlike yesterday's exploratory interactions, today you've seen how Sidekick
connects multiple capabilities—research, calendar integration, and intelligent
action—into seamless workflows that mirror how you actually work.

  Connect more deeply with your schedule. Learn to have Sidekick draft your
  morning stand-up updates based on your calendar.
</Card>

## Pro tip for today

Before tomorrow's session, try asking Sidekick:

```text
What did you learn about my work style and preferences from our interactions yesterday and today?
```

This begins training Sidekick to understand your specific needs and
communication style across multiple sessions.

---

**Time to complete**: ~10 minutes

**Skills learned**: practical agent research, calendar integration, workflow
automation, real-world task delegation

**Next** day 3 - Morning stand-up automation with calendar intelligence

<Tip>
  **Remember** you're not just using a tool—you're training an assistant. Every
  interaction teaches Sidekick more about how you work, building on the
  foundation from Day 1.
