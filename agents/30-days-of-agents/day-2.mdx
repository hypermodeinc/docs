<Card title="Day 2 challenge" icon="calendar-check">
  **Goal**: automate your daily stand-up preparation

**Theme**: foundation week - calendar intelligence

**Time investment**: ~10 minutes

</Card>

Welcome back! Yesterday you experienced how Sidekick researches and creates
calendar events. Today we're going deeper into calendar intelligence—having
Sidekick understand your schedule and automatically draft your daily stand-up
updates.

This is where you see the power of agents that understand context, not just
commands.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Ensure your Google Calendar connection is active
- Have Sidekick analyze your day's schedule
- Generate a draft stand-up update based on your meetings
- Experience how agents interpret calendar context

<Warning>
  This isn't about reading your calendar aloud. Sidekick analyzes meeting
  patterns, identifies priorities, and suggests talking points for your
  stand-up.
</Warning>

## Step 1: verify your calendar connection

If you completed Day 1, your Google Calendar should already be connected. Let's
verify and explore what Sidekick can see:

**Ask Sidekick:**

```text
What meetings do I have today? Can you see my calendar?
```

![Calendar Connection Status - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day2-calendar-check.png)

Sidekick should be able to:

- List your meetings for today
- Show meeting times and attendees
- Identify meeting types (1:1&nbsp;s, team meetings, external calls)

<Info>
  If your calendar isn't connected, follow the connection steps from Day 1.
  Sidekick guides you through the OAuth flow.
</Info>

## Step 2: request your stand-up draft

Now for the magic. Instead of manually reviewing your calendar and thinking
about what to share in stand-up, let Sidekick do the analysis:

```text
Based on my calendar today, can you draft my morning stand-up update?
Include what I'm working on, any blockers you can identify from my schedule, and what I focus on today.
```

Watch how Sidekick:

- Analyzes your meeting types and identifies work streams
- Spots potential scheduling conflicts or back-to-back meetings
- Suggests priorities based on meeting importance and attendees
- Drafts talking points in a natural, conversational tone

<Tip>
  **Agent learning moment**: notice how Sidekick infers context from calendar
  data. It's interpreting patterns and making intelligent
  suggestions.
</Tip>

## Step 3: refine your stand-up style

Your stand-up format might be different from Sidekick's initial draft. Let's
teach it your team's style:

```text
Our stand-ups follow this format:
- Yesterday's accomplishments
- Today's priorities (max 3 items)
- Any blockers or help needed

Can you redraft my update in this format? Also, our team prefers bullet points over paragraphs.
```

Sidekick adapts the content to match your team's preferred structure and
communication style.

## Step 4: identify intelligent insights

Ask Sidekick to go beyond basic calendar reading:

```text
Looking at my schedule, what patterns do you notice?
Are there any potential issues or optimization opportunities for my day?
```

Sidekick might identify:

- **Time blocks**: "You have three 1:1&nbsp;s back-to-back 2–3:30 PM"
- **Preparation needs**: "Your client presentation at 4 PM follows immediately
  after your team planning session"
- **Travel time**: "Note the location change between your 10 AM and 11 AM
  meetings"
- **Energy management**: "Consider scheduling buffer time before your most
  important calls"

## What just happened?

In just 10 minutes, you've experienced sophisticated calendar intelligence:

**Context understanding**: Sidekick doesn't just read calendar entries—it
interprets meeting types, identifies work streams, and understands priorities

**Pattern recognition**: It spots scheduling conflicts, preparation
opportunities, and workflow optimizations

**Communication intelligence**: It adapts content format and tone to match your
team's communication style

**Proactive insights**: Beyond the immediate request, it offers strategic
suggestions for time management

## The power of calendar intelligence

Unlike static calendar apps, Sidekick understands the story your schedule tells.
It can identify when you're overbooked, suggest optimal meeting prep time, and
even recognize when you need buffer time between high-stakes meetings.

## Pro tip for today

Before tomorrow's session, try this experiment:

```text

```

This teaches Sidekick to think strategically about your time management, not
just report what's scheduled.
