<Card title="Day 4 challenge" icon="calendar-days">
  **Goal**: automate daily agenda preparation with actionable insights

**Theme**: foundation week - calendar intelligence & communication

**Time investment**: ~10 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 4! Yesterday you experienced how Sidekick analyzes your schedule
and drafts stand-up updates. Today we're advancing to comprehensive daily agenda
preparation—having Sidekick create detailed meeting notes and draft follow-up
emails based on your calendar context.

This is where you see agents move beyond simple scheduling to strategic daily
management.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Generate a comprehensive daily agenda with meeting-specific notes
- Have Sidekick draft context-aware email templates for meeting follow-ups
- Experience predictive meeting preparation and action item management
- Learn how agents connect calendar data to communication strategies

<Warning>
  This isn't about copying calendar entries. Sidekick analyzes meeting types,
  attendees, and context to suggest specific talking points, potential outcomes,
  and strategic follow-up actions.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Request your daily agenda preparation

Building on yesterday's calendar intelligence, let's have Sidekick create a
comprehensive agenda for your day:

**Ask Sidekick:**

```text
Based on my calendar today, can you prepare my daily agenda with contextual notes for each meeting?
Include suggested talking points, potential outcomes, and any preparation I should do beforehand.
```

Watch how Sidekick:

- Analyzes each meeting's purpose based on title, attendees, and timing
- Suggests specific talking points relevant to each meeting type
- Identifies potential decisions or outcomes to prepare for
- Recommends pre-meeting preparation based on attendee profiles
- Notes optimal meeting flow and transition strategies

<Tip>
  **Agent learning moment** notice how Sidekick infers meeting context and
  purpose from minimal calendar data. it's using pattern recognition to suggest
  relevant business outcomes and conversation topics.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Generate meeting-specific preparation notes

Let's get more specific about your most important meeting today:

```text
For my most important meeting today, can you create detailed preparation notes?
Include background research on attendees, suggested agenda items, potential objections or questions I might face, and key outcomes I should aim for.
```

![Meeting Preparation Notes](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day4-meeting-prep.png)

Sidekick provides:

- **Attendee context**: roles, recent company news, potential interests
- **Strategic talking points**: relevant to meeting objectives and attendee
  priorities
- **Anticipated challenges**: common objections or difficult questions to
  prepare for
- **Success metrics**: clear outcomes to aim for and how to measure meeting
  success

## Step 3: Draft follow-up email templates

Now for the powerful part—having Sidekick prepare email follow-ups before
meetings even happen:

```text
Based on my agenda today, can you draft email templates for potential follow-up actions?
Create templates for: meeting recap emails, action item assignments, scheduling next steps, and sharing relevant resources.
Tailor each template to the specific meeting type and attendees.
```

![email Template Generation](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day4-email-templates.png)

Sidekick creates customized templates such as:

- **Meeting recap emails**: structured summaries with key decisions and next
  steps
- **Action item assignments**: clear task delegation with deadlines and context
- **Follow-up scheduling**: templates for booking next meetings based on
  outcomes
- **Resource sharing**: contextual document or link sharing based on discussion
  topics

<Tip>
  **Pro insight** Sidekick tailors language, formality, and content based on
  attendee relationships, meeting types, and your communication history.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Strategic day optimization

Ask Sidekick to go beyond agenda creation to strategic optimization:

```text
Looking at my full agenda, what strategic opportunities should I watch for today?
Are there any cross-meeting synergies, networking possibilities, or ways to maximize the value of my time?
```

Sidekick might identify:

- **Cross-meeting connections**: "your 2 PM discussion about budget could inform
  your 4 PM vendor meeting"
- **Relationship opportunities**: "two attendees from different meetings work on
  related projects—consider introducing them"
- **Information leverage**: "insights from your morning client call could
  strengthen your afternoon proposal presentation"
- **Energy management**: "schedule your most challenging conversation after your
  team win at 11 AM"

## What just happened?

In 10 minutes, you've experienced sophisticated daily intelligence:

**Predictive preparation** Sidekick doesn't just read your calendar—it
anticipates meeting needs, potential outcomes, and required follow-up actions

**Context-aware communication** email templates aren't generic—they're tailored
to specific relationships, meeting types, and expected outcomes

**Strategic management** Beyond individual meetings, Sidekick identifies
cross-meeting opportunities and day optimization strategies

**Proactive action planning** Rather than reactive follow-ups, you now have
prepared templates that anticipate common meeting outcomes

## The power of contextual intelligence

Unlike basic calendar apps or generic email templates, Sidekick understands the
flow of business relationships and decision-making. It connects the dots between
meetings, anticipates outcomes, and prepares you for the communication
strategies that drive business forward.

## Pro tip for today

After each meeting today, tell Sidekick what actually happened:

```text
My 2 PM meeting with [person] went differently than expected. Here's what actually happened: [brief summary].
How should I adjust my follow-up approach and what can you learn for future meeting preparation?
```

This teaches Sidekick to improve its meeting prediction accuracy and follow-up
suggestions based on real outcomes.
