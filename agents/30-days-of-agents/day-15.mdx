<Card title="Day 15 challenge" icon="users">
  **Goal**: create customer intelligence agents with CRM and spreadsheet mastery

**Theme**: domain specialization week - customer & operational intelligence

**Time investment**: ~20 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 15! You'll complete Week 3 by building **customer intelligence
agents** that bridge modern CRM (Attio) with operational spreadsheets (Google
Sheets). These agents transform disconnected data into unified customer
insights.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Build agents that understand customer relationships and sales processes
- Connect Attio for modern CRM intelligence
- Integrate Google Sheets for operational data and reporting
- Create unified views across sales and operational systems

<Warning>
  You'll need access to Attio and Google Sheets to complete today's exercises.
  The patterns apply to any CRM and spreadsheet combination.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding customer intelligence patterns

Customer intelligence agents must understand:

### CRM intelligence (Attio)

- **Relationship mapping**: Companies, contacts, and their interactions
- **Pipeline dynamics**: Deal flow, conversion rates, and bottlenecks
- **Activity patterns**: What actions correlate with successful outcomes
- **Data enrichment**: Combining CRM data with external intelligence

### Operational intelligence (Google sheets)

- **Flexible reporting**: Custom metrics and calculations
- **Data bridging**: Information that lives outside the CRM
- **Historical tracking**: Trends and patterns over time
- **Team accessibility**: Shared operational dashboards

<Tip>
  **Unified thinking** your agent should understand that CRMs track
  relationships while spreadsheets often contain the operational truth.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Create customer intelligence agents

Work with Concierge to build a unified intelligence agent:

```text
I want to create a customer intelligence agent that works with Attio and Google Sheets.

The agent should:
- Monitor deal pipeline in Attio and update forecasting sheets
- Enrich CRM data with operational metrics from spreadsheets
- Generate unified customer health scores combining both sources
- Alert on mismatches between CRM pipeline and operational data
- Create executive dashboards that merge relationship and operational insights

It should think like a revenue operations analyst who sees the full picture.
```

## Step 3: Connect Attio and Google Sheets

### Attio capabilities

Your agent can:

- **Manage relationships**: Create and update companies, contacts, deals
- **Track activities**: Log interactions, meetings, and touchpoints
- **Analyze pipelines**: Deal stages, conversion rates, and velocity
- **Custom attributes**: Work with your specific data model

### Google sheets capabilities

Your agent can:

- **Read/write data**: Update cells, ranges, and formulas
- **Create reports**: Generate new sheets with formatted data
- **Process calculations**: Run complex operational metrics
- **Maintain history**: Track changes over time

## Step 4: Implement unified workflows

### Workflow 1: Pipeline-to-forecast synchronization

```text
Can you analyze our current Attio pipeline and update our revenue forecast sheet?
Include deal probability based on stage and historical conversion rates.
```

Your agent:

- Pulls current pipeline from Attio
- Calculates weighted revenue by stage
- Updates forecast spreadsheet with breakdown
- Highlights changes from last update

### Workflow 2: Customer health scoring

```text
Create a unified customer health score combining:
- Attio: engagement frequency, deal value, relationship strength
- Sheets: product usage, support tickets, payment history

Identify at-risk accounts that need attention.
```

The agent:

- Merges relationship data with operational metrics
- Calculates composite health scores
- Flags accounts with declining indicators
- Suggests intervention strategies

## Step 5: Build automated intelligence tasks

**Weekly sales intelligence report**:

```text
Every Monday, create a sales intelligence report that:
1. Summarizes pipeline changes in Attio
2. Updates win rate calculations in our metrics sheet
3. Identifies deals stuck in stages too long
4. Compares CRM pipeline to operational forecasts
5. Highlights data discrepancies needing cleanup

Format for our executive team meeting.
```

**Customer success automation**:

```text
Daily, monitor for:
- New deals closed in Attio → Create onboarding checklist in Sheets
- Usage drops in Sheets data → Update account status in Attio
- Support tickets in Sheets → Log activities in Attio
- Payment issues in Sheets → Flag deals at risk in Attio

Keep both systems synchronized for accurate customer view.
```

<Info>
  **TODO** Advanced Attio workflow automation and custom object management can
  be covered in future sessions.
</Info>

## What you've accomplished

In 20 minutes, you've built comprehensive customer intelligence:

**Unified data view** agents that bridge CRM and operational data

**Automated synchronization** keep multiple systems aligned automatically

**Intelligent insights** combine relationship and operational intelligence

**Proactive alerts** catch issues before they impact revenue

## Week 3 complete: Domain specialization achieved

You've completed Week 3 and mastered domain-specific agent development:

- **Day 11**: Financial intelligence with Stripe
- **Day 12**: Development workflows with GitHub and Vercel
- **Day 13**: Project coordination with Linear and Notion
- **Day 14**: Data analytics with Neo4j and MongoDB
- **Day 15**: Customer intelligence with Attio and Google Sheets

## The power of domain expertise

Your agents now:

- **Understand business context**, not just tool APIs
- **Think like domain experts** in their specialized areas
- **Connect disparate systems** into unified intelligence
- **Provide actionable insights**, not just data movement

<Card title="Week 4 Coming Soon" icon="arrow-right">
  **Production deployment and optimization** - Take your agents from development
  to business-critical production systems with monitoring, scaling, and
  performance optimization.
</Card>

## Pro tip for Week 3

Ask any of your domain agents:

```text
What patterns have you noticed that could fundamentally change how we operate?
What would a 10x improvement look like in your domain?
```

This pushes agents beyond automation to transformation.
