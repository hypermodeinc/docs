  **Goal**: build sophisticated development agents that automate code reviews, manage deployments, and coordinate release workflows

**Theme**: domain specialization week - development & infrastructure

**Time investment**: ~30 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 12! Today you'll specialize in development and infrastructure by
building agents that understand code, deployments, and development workflows.
You'll integrate GitHub for repository management and Vercel for deployment
automation, creating agents that act like senior DevOps engineers.

This isn't just about connecting tools—it's about building agents that
understand development best practices, can review code intelligently, and manage
production deployments safely.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Build a development agent that combines GitHub and Vercel capabilities
- Create intelligent code review workflows that go beyond syntax checking
- Implement automated deployment pipelines with safety checks
- Develop monitoring and rollback capabilities for production systems
- Learn domain-specific patterns for development and infrastructure agents

<Warning>
  This builds on your Week 2 agent creation skills. You'll need access to GitHub
  and Vercel accounts with appropriate permissions to complete today's
  exercises.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding development agent patterns

Before building, understand what makes development agents different from
general-purpose agents:

### Code understanding capabilities

Development agents need to:

- **Analyze code quality** beyond just syntax—understanding patterns, security
  implications, and performance
- **Understand project context** from README files, documentation, and code
  structure
- **Follow coding standards** specific to languages, frameworks, and team
  conventions
- **Assess risk levels** for changes based on file criticality and change scope

### Deployment intelligence

Infrastructure agents must:

- **Coordinate deployments** across environments (development, staging,
  production)
- **Monitor build status** and understand when deployments are safe
- **Implement rollback strategies** when issues are detected
- **Manage environment variables** and configuration securely

<Tip>
  **Domain expertise matters**: Development agents need to understand not just
  how to use GitHub and Vercel APIs, but when and why to use specific features
  based on development best practices.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Create your development agent with Concierge

Let's build a sophisticated development agent that combines code management and
deployment capabilities:

**Start with Concierge:**

```text
I want to create a development and infrastructure agent that helps me manage code reviews and deployments.

The agent should:
- Review pull requests on GitHub for code quality, security issues, and best practices
- Manage deployments to Vercel with proper staging and production workflows
- Monitor deployment status and performance metrics
- Coordinate releases between code merges and deployments
- Provide intelligent insights about code changes and their potential impact

I want it to act like a senior DevOps engineer who understands both code quality and production stability.
```

### Example agent configuration

Based on the GitHub Review Bot example from the gallery, enhance your agent with
these capabilities:

**Core responsibilities:**

- Automated code review with actionable feedback
- Deployment coordination with safety checks
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Release note generation
- Rollback automation when issues detected

**Key integrations needed:**

- **GitHub**: Repository access, PR management, issue tracking
- **Vercel**: Deployment management, environment configuration, monitoring
- **Slack** (optional): Team notifications for important events

## Step 3: Implement intelligent code review workflows

Your development agent should go beyond basic linting. Drawing from the GitHub
Review Bot example:

**Configure advanced review capabilities:**

```text
When reviewing pull requests, analyze:

1. Code Quality Patterns:
   - Clean code principles and readability
   - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) violations
   - Function complexity and refactoring opportunities
   - Consistent naming conventions

2. Security Analysis:
   - Hardcoded secrets or API keys
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) risks
   - Dependency vulnerabilities

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Database query optimization
   - Memory leak potential
   - Unnecessary re-renders (for React)
   - Bundle size impact

4. Testing Coverage:
   - Missing test cases
   - Edge case handling
   - Integration test requirements

Provide specific line numbers and code examples for all feedback.
Use severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low.
Always include positive feedback for well-written code sections.
```

### Example code review interaction

```text
You: Review PR #142 in our main repository - it's adding a new authentication system.

Agent: I've completed the review of PR #142 - "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication system". Here's my analysis:

**Overall Score: 8/10**

**Critical Issues:**
• Line 45 in auth.js: Hardcoded client secret should be moved to environment variables
• Line 128 in middleware.js: Missing input validation for JWT tokens could lead to injection attacks

**Security Recommendations:**
• Add rate limiting to login endpoints (auth.js:67-89)
• Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security
• Consider adding PKCE flow for public clients

**Performance Optimizations:**
• Token validation is happening on every request - implement caching (middleware.js:34)
• Database queries in getUserProfile() could be optimized with indexes

**Positive Highlights:**
• Excellent test coverage at 94%
• Clean separation of auth and authorization logic
• Proper error handling without leaking sensitive info

**Deployment Considerations:**
• Will need to update Vercel environment variables before deployment
• Database migrations required for refresh_tokens table
• Consider feature flag for gradual rollout

Ready to proceed with deployment after addressing critical issues.
```

## Step 4: Automate deployment workflows with Vercel

Now let's add sophisticated deployment capabilities:

**Configure deployment intelligence:**

```text
For deployment workflows, implement:

1. Pre-deployment Checks:
   - All CI/CD tests passing
   - No critical security issues in code review
   - Database migrations ready if needed
   - Environment variables configured

2. Staging Deployment First:
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run smoke tests automatically
   - Check performance metrics
   - Verify no errors in logs

3. Production Deployment:
   - Only after staging validation
   - Implement canary or blue-green deployment
   - Monitor error rates and performance
   - Automatic rollback if error threshold exceeded

4. Post-deployment Monitoring:
   - Track Core Web Vitals
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check API response times
   - Alert on anomalies
```

### Example deployment workflow

```text
You: The PR has been approved. Deploy the authentication changes to production.

Agent: I'll coordinate the deployment of the authentication system to production. Let me start with our safety checks:

**Pre-deployment Validation:**
✅ All GitHub Actions tests passing (last run: 2 minutes ago)
✅ Critical security issues from code review have been addressed
✅ PR #142 merged to main branch
✅ Vercel preview deployment successful

**Staging Deployment:**
Deploying to staging environment...
✅ Deployment successful: https://app-staging.vercel.app
✅ Running automated smoke tests...
  - Login flow: PASS (avg 230ms)
  - Token refresh: PASS (avg 145ms)
  - Logout flow: PASS (avg 89ms)
✅ No errors in staging logs (monitored for 5 minutes)

**Production Deployment Plan:**
I'll use a canary deployment strategy:
1. Deploy to 10% of traffic first
2. Monitor for 15 minutes
3. If metrics are stable, deploy to 100%

Shall I proceed with the canary deployment to production?

[After confirmation]

**Production Deployment Progress:**
🚀 Deploying to production (10% canary)...
✅ Canary deployment live
📊 Monitoring metrics for 15 minutes...
  - Error rate: 0.01% (baseline: 0.02%) ✅
  - Response time: 122ms (baseline: 118ms) ✅
  - CPU usage: 34% (baseline: 32%) ✅

All metrics look healthy. Promoting to 100% traffic...
✅ Full production deployment complete!

**Deployment Summary:**
- URL: https://app.vercel.app
- Build ID: dpl_Fk3j2k4j2k3j4
- Duration: 18 minutes total
- Features: OAuth 2.0 authentication system

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor error rates for next 24 hours
2. Review user feedback on new auth flow
3. Plan gradual feature flag rollout for existing users

I'll continue monitoring and alert you if any issues arise.
```

## Step 5: Implement production monitoring and rollback

Your agent should be capable of handling production issues:

**Configure monitoring and rollback:**

```text
Monitor production health by:

1. Tracking Key Metrics:
   - Error rates (baseline vs current)
   - Response times (P50, P95, P99)
   - Core Web Vitals scores
   - Active user sessions

2. Automated Rollback Triggers:
   - Error rate increases >5% from baseline
   - Response time degradation >20%
   - Multiple user reports of issues
   - Critical service dependencies failing

3. Rollback Process:
   - Immediately revert to previous deployment
   - Notify team via Slack
   - Create incident report
   - Begin root cause analysis
```

### Example monitoring and rollback

```text
You: How's the authentication deployment performing in production?

Agent: I'm monitoring the authentication deployment. Here's the current status:

**Production Health Check (2 hours post-deployment):**

📊 **Performance Metrics:**
- Error rate: 0.03% (↑ 0.01% from baseline) - Within normal range
- Login success rate: 98.7% (previously 97.2%) - Improved! ✅
- Avg response time: 124ms (baseline: 118ms) - Acceptable
- Active sessions: 3,247 (normal for this time)

⚠️ **Detected Issue:**
I've noticed an increase in "token refresh failed" errors in the last 15 minutes:
- Affected users: 47 (1.4% of active users)
- Error pattern: Timeout errors from auth service
- Started: 14:23 UTC

**Investigating:**
- Checking Vercel function logs... Found timeout issues with the refresh endpoint
- Database connection pool may be exhausted
- This could escalate if not addressed

**Recommended Action:**
This doesn't meet automatic rollback criteria yet, but I recommend:
1. Increase database connection pool size (quick fix)
2. Or rollback if errors increase beyond 2%

Would you like me to apply the quick fix or initiate a rollback?
```

## Step 6: Create development best practices automation

Extend your agent to enforce and automate development best practices:

**Advanced automation patterns:**

```text
Implement these automated workflows:

1. Dependency Management:
   - Weekly dependency update PRs
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Breaking change detection
   - Automated testing of updates

2. Documentation Sync:
   - Update API docs when endpoints change
   - Generate changelog from PR descriptions
   - Keep README synchronized with actual setup
   - Create architecture diagrams from code

3. Performance Budget Enforcement:
   - Block deployments exceeding bundle size limits
   - Warn on significant performance regressions
   - Track and report Core Web Vitals trends
   - Suggest optimization opportunities

4. Release Coordination:
   - Generate release notes from merged PRs
   - Coordinate database migrations with deployments
   - Manage feature flags for gradual rollouts
   - Schedule deployments for optimal times
```

## What you've accomplished

In 30 minutes, you've built a sophisticated development and infrastructure agent
that:

**Code intelligence**: Reviews code with understanding of quality, security, and
performance implications beyond basic syntax

**Deployment orchestration**: Manages complex deployment workflows with staging
validation, canary releases, and automatic rollbacks
