<Card title="Day 6 challenge" icon="rocket">
  **Goal**: unlock Hypermode Pro and meet Concierge

**Theme**: community week - fast track to advanced capabilities

**Time investment**: ~10 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 6! You've mastered the fundamentals with Sidekick over the past
week. Today marks a significant milestone—unlocking access to **Hypermode Pro**
through our fast track program and meeting **Concierge**, the AI agent that
builds AI agents.

This isn't just about upgrading your account. You're gaining access to 2,000+
integrations and the power to create custom agents tailored to your specific
needs.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Get your instant Pro access code from Discord community participation
- Apply the code at the fast track page
- Meet Concierge - the AI agent that builds AI agents
- Understand what Pro unlocks for tomorrow's agent creation
- Prepare for building your first custom agent

<Warning>
  Pro access codes are exclusively distributed through Discord community
  engagement and weekly live streams. Active participation is required to
  receive codes.

  inspiration for advanced agent projects
</Card>

## Step 1: access the fast track program

The fastest way to unlock Hypermode Pro is through our dedicated fast track
program:

**Visit the fast track page:**

<Card
  title="Fast Track to Pro"
  icon="star"
  href="https://hypermode.com/fast-track"
>
  Get instant access to Hypermode Pro with 2,000+ integrations and custom agent
  creation
</Card>

**What the fast track provides:**

- **Immediate Pro access** - no waiting for Discord events or community codes
- **All Pro features unlocked** - 2,000+ integrations, custom agents, advanced
  workflows
- **Direct path to building** - start creating custom agents tomorrow
- **Community access included** - invitation to join the Discord builder
  community

<Tip>
  **Fast track advantage**: while others wait for community codes, you get
  immediate access and can start building custom agents tomorrow.
</Tip>

## Step 2 apply your Pro code

After visiting the fast track page, you'll receive a simple modal with your Pro
access code:

![Fast Track Code Modal](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day-6-fast-track.png)

**Apply your code:**

1. **Copy the Pro access code** from the modal
2. **Refresh your workspace** to see Pro features

Once complete, you'll see the Concierge agent appear in your sidebar:

![Hypermode with Concierge](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day-6-fast-track-complete.png)

**Pro features now unlocked:**

- **Concierge agent** available in your workspace sidebar
- **Extended connection library** with 2,000+ options
- **Custom agent creation** capabilities unlocked
- **Advanced workflow tools** accessible

## Step 3 meet Concierge

**Concierge** is fundamentally different from Sidekick. While Sidekick is a
productivity agent, Concierge is a meta-agent—an AI that specializes in building
other AIs.

**Start a brief conversation with Concierge:**

```text
Hi Concierge! I just unlocked Pro through the fast track program. Can you tell me what you do and how you help build custom agents?
```

Watch how Concierge:

- Explains its role as an agent builder
- Describes the types of agents it can create
- Outlines the agent creation process
- Connects business needs to technical capabilities

<Tip>
  **Meta-AI concept** Concierge represents a new category of AI—agents that
  create other agents. Tomorrow you'll experience this firsthand.
</Tip>

## Step 4 understand what Pro unlocks

With Hypermode Pro access, here's what becomes available:

### 2,000+ integrations

Beyond Sidekick's built-in capabilities, Pro gives you access to:

- **Development tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear, Vercel
- **Business tools**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, QuickBooks
- **Productivity**: Notion, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Workspace
- **Data platforms**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Tableau, Looker
- **Custom APIs**: Connect your internal tools and services

### Custom agent creation

**Tomorrow you'll use Concierge to build agents for specific domains:**

- Sales pipeline management
- Customer support automation
- Marketing insights and reporting
- Developer productivity tools
- Content creation and management

### Advanced capabilities

- **Multi-agent workflows**: Agents that work together on complex tasks
- **Custom tool integration**: Connect proprietary systems and APIs
- **Advanced monitoring**: Deep insights into agent performance
- **Export to code**: Production-ready applications when you're ready

<Info>
  Pro isn't just about more features—it's about moving from using agents to
  building agent-powered solutions for your specific needs.
</Info>
