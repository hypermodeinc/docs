Welcome to Day 6! You've mastered the fundamentals with Sidekick over the past

builders and unlocking access to **Hypermode Pro**, which gives you the power to
create custom agents with 2,000+ integrations.

This isn't just about upgrading your account. You're joining a community of
builders who are defining the future of agent-powered work.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Join the Discord community of agent builders

- Get your exclusive Hypermode Pro access code
- Understand what Pro unlocks for the remaining weeks
- Experience the difference between Sidekick and custom agent creation

<Warning>
  Hypermode Pro access codes are exclusively distributed through the Discord
  community. You won't find them anywhere else—this creates a curated community
  of serious agent builders.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Join the Discord community

The Hypermode Discord is where agent builders connect, share wins, troubleshoot
challenges, and get early access to new features.

## Step 4: Community participation strategies

Make the most of your Discord community membership:

### Share your Week 1 wins

Looking forward to building custom agents in Week 2!
```

### Ask strategic questions

**Examples of valuable community questions:**

```text
"For those building sales agents - what integrations have been most valuable?"

"Has anyone used agents for customer support? What workflows worked best?"

"What's the biggest time-saver you've created with agents?"
```

### Offer help to others

**Ways to contribute:**

- Answer questions about Week 1 concepts for newcomers
- Share specific examples of successful workflows
