## What you'll accomplish today

- Research a contact for an upcoming meeting
- Connect your Google Calendar
- Create a calendar event through conversation
- Experience how agents think and respond

<Warning>
  This is **not** just another chat interface. Sidekick is built to act, not
  just chat. You'll see the difference immediately.
</Warning>

## Step 1 research your contact

Let's start with a classic scenario: you have a meeting tomorrow with someone,
and you want to be prepared. We'll use Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, as our
example.

**Start a new thread with Sidekick** and try this prompt:

```text
I am meeting with Sam Altman from OpenAI tomorrow.
Can you research him and prepare some notes for me?
```

![Sidekick Research - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day1-research.png)

Watch how Sidekick:

- Searches for current information about Sam Altman
- Organizes findings into actionable meeting notes
- Provides context that's actually useful for conversation
- Includes recent developments and OpenAI updates

<Tip>
  **Agent Learning Moment**: notice how Sidekick structures information for
  practical use, not just information dump. This is the difference between
  search and intelligence.
</Tip>

## Step 2 connect Google Calendar

Now let's connect your Google Calendar so Sidekick can manage your schedule.

1. **Add the Google Calendar connection** from the connections panel
2. **Complete the OAuth flow** when prompted
3. **Confirm connection** in your workspace settings

<Info>
  Google Calendar is included free with every Hypermode account. Want access to
  2,000+ more connections? [Upgrade to Hypermode Pro](/agents/connections).

## Step 3 create your meeting

With your calendar connected, let's schedule that meeting with Sam Altman:

```text
Create an event tomorrow at 2pm PT for my meeting with Sam Altman.
Title it "Meeting with Sam Altman - OpenAI Discussion" and add the research notes you prepared as the description.
Since we don't have Sam's actual email, please use [YOUR_EMAIL_HERE] as a placeholder for the attendee.
```

![Calendar Event Creation - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day1-create-event.png)

Sidekick:

- Creates the calendar event at the specified time
- Includes your research notes in the description
- Confirms the meeting details

## What just happened?

In under 10 minutes, you've experienced what makes Hypermode Agents different:

**Intelligence**: sidekick didn't just search—it prepared actionable meeting
notes with current information about Sam Altman and OpenAI

**Integration**: connected to your real tools (Google Calendar)

**Action**: actually created the calendar event, not just suggestions

**Natural**: all through conversation, no forms or complex interfaces

**Current**: used web search to get the latest information about your contact

## The power of real-time research

Unlike static examples, researching Sam Altman demonstrates how Sidekick handles
real-world scenarios where information changes frequently. You've just
experienced an agent that can research current events, recent interviews,
company developments, and industry context—all essential for productive business
meetings.

communication style.
