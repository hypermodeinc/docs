## Step 1: explore the Sidekick interface

When you first open Sidekick, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the
interface. Notice the key elements that make this different from standard AI
chat:

**Key interface elements:**

- **Chat area**: Where you interact with Sidekick naturally

**Start with a simple greeting:**

```text
Hello Sidekick! I'm starting the 30 Days of Agents program.
Can you tell me what makes you different from other AI assistants?
```

Notice how Sidekick explains its capabilities and agent-like features.

<Tip>
  **Agent learning moment** Sidekick can take real actions, not just provide
  suggestions. This fundamental difference shapes how you interact with it.
</Tip>

## Step 2: test web search capabilities

One of Sidekick's core strengths is real-time web search. Let's test this with
current information:

**Try this search request:**

```text
Can you search for the latest news about AI developments this week?
I'm particularly interested in any major announcements or breakthroughs.
```

```

Notice how Sidekick retrieves real-time information and presents it in a
structured, actionable format.

## Step 3: explore LinkedIn and professional research

Sidekick excels at professional research. Let's test its ability to find and
analyze professional information:

**Try this LinkedIn-style research:**

```text

I'd like to know about his current activities, recent posts or articles, and any speaking engagements or interviews.
```

Sidekick can:

**Try company research:**

```text

  synthesizes professional context that's actually useful for business
  relationships and decision-making.
