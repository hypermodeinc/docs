<Card title="Day 9 challenge" icon="repeat">
  **Goal**: create reusable tasks from successful workflows

**Theme**: community week - workflow optimization and reusability

**Time investment**: ~15 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 9! Over the past two days, you've built custom agents and
sophisticated workflows. Today you'll learn to capture these successes as
**reusable tasks**—turning one-time interactions into scalable, repeatable
skills that anyone can use.

Tasks are how agent capabilities evolve from experimental to institutional
knowledge.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Understand the difference between conversations and tasks
- Convert successful workflows into reusable tasks
- Create task libraries that scale across teams
- Learn task parameterization and customization
- Experience how tasks transform agent utility

<Warning>
  This builds on Days 7-8's agent creation and workflow development. You'll need
  the custom agent and workflows you've built to complete today's activities.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding tasks vs. conversations

Before creating tasks, understand what makes them powerful:

**Conversations** are exploratory and unique:

- One-time problem solving
- Iterative refinement and discovery
- Learning and experimentation
- Context-specific solutions

**Tasks** are structured and repeatable:

- Standardized workflows
- Consistent outputs
- Scalable across users and scenarios
- Institutional knowledge capture

**Ask your agent to explain this distinction:**

```text
Looking at our recent conversations, which interactions would make good reusable tasks?
What's the difference between our exploratory discussions and workflows that could benefit others?
```

<Tip>
  **The task mindset** think about which workflows would be valuable if someone
  else could execute them without needing to understand all the context and
  iteration that went into creating them.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Identify task-worthy workflows

Review your recent agent interactions to identify candidates for task creation:

### Evaluation criteria

**High reusability potential:**

```text
Can you review our recent workflows and identify which ones would be most valuable
as reusable tasks? Consider:
- How often might this workflow be needed?
- Could other people benefit from this process?
- Is the workflow general enough to work in different contexts?
- Does it follow a consistent, logical sequence?
```

**Clear input/output patterns:**

```text
Which of our workflows have clear inputs (what information is needed to start)
and predictable outputs (what the user gets at the end)?
```

**Standardizable processes:**

```text
Which workflows follow a consistent process that could work across different
scenarios with minor modifications?
```

### Common task patterns

**Research and analysis tasks:**

- Market research with standardized reporting
- Competitive analysis with consistent frameworks
- Customer feedback analysis and insights

**Workflow automation tasks:**

- Meeting preparation with agenda and research
- Project status reporting across tools
- Content creation and distribution workflows

**Data processing tasks:**

- Lead qualification and routing
- Performance metric compilation
- Compliance check and reporting

## Step 3: Create your first task

Let's convert one of your successful workflows into a reusable task.

### Choose your workflow

Select a workflow from yesterday or earlier that worked particularly well:

```text
I want to turn our [specific workflow] into a reusable task.
This workflow was successful because [reason], and I think it would be valuable for [who else could use it].

Can you help me create a task from this workflow?
```

![Task Creation Process - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day9-task-creation.png)

### Define task parameters

Work with your agent to structure the task:

**Task name and description:**

```text
What should we call this task, and how should we describe it so someone else
could understand its purpose and value?
```

**Required inputs:**

```text
What information does someone need to provide to run this task successfully?
What are the minimum required inputs vs. optional parameters?
```

**Expected outputs:**

```text
What will users receive when this task completes? How should the results be
formatted for maximum usefulness?
```

**Customization options:**

```text
What aspects of this workflow should be customizable based on different use cases
or user preferences?
```

<Info>
  Well-designed tasks balance standardization (consistent, reliable execution)
  with flexibility (adaptable to different contexts and needs).
</Info>

## Step 4: Test task execution

Once your task is created, test it to ensure reliability and usability:

### Test with your own scenarios

```text
Let's test this task with different inputs to make sure it works reliably.
Can you run it with [scenario 1], then [scenario 2], and show me how the
outputs differ appropriately?
```

### Simulate different user contexts

```text
How would this task work for someone who isn't familiar with [your domain]?
Can you walk through it as if you're helping a new user understand both the
process and the results?
```

### Identify edge cases

```text
What happens if someone provides incomplete information or unexpected inputs?
How does the task handle errors or unusual scenarios gracefully?
```

## Step 5: Build a task library

Create multiple tasks to build a comprehensive skill library for your agent:

### Task categories

Organize tasks by function and complexity:

**Quick wins (5-10 minute tasks):**

- Research summaries
- Data formatting and analysis
- Quick competitive checks
- Meeting prep basics

**Workflow automation (15-30 minute tasks):**

- Multi-step research and reporting
- Cross-platform data synchronization
- Content creation and distribution
- Project status compilation

**Complex orchestration (30+ minute tasks):**

- End-to-end campaign creation
- Comprehensive analysis and recommendations
- Multi-stakeholder workflow coordination
- Strategic planning and execution

### Task relationships

```text
Looking at the tasks we've created, how do they relate to each other?
Could some tasks use outputs from others? Are there opportunities to chain
tasks together for more complex workflows?
```

## Step 6: Optimize task performance

Make your tasks more effective and user-friendly:

### Improve task clarity

```text
For each task, let's create clear descriptions that explain:
- What problem this task solves
- What information users need to provide
- What they'll receive as output
- How long the task typically takes
- When this task is most useful
```

### Add usage examples

```text
Can you create example scenarios for each task that show typical use cases
and expected results? This will help new users understand when and how to use each task.
```

### Build task chaining

```text
How can we design tasks that work well together? Can we create workflows where
the output of one task becomes the input for another?
```

<Tip>
  **Task evolution** great tasks improve over time based on usage patterns and
  user feedback. Design them to be easily refinable and extendable.
</Tip>

## What you've accomplished

In 15 minutes, you've transformed from ad-hoc agent interaction to systematic
workflow management:

**Captured institutional knowledge** converted successful workflows into
reusable assets

**Scaled productivity** created tasks that others can execute without learning
your specific process

**Built consistency** standardized outputs and quality across repeated
executions

**Enabled delegation** made complex workflows accessible to team members with
different skill levels

**Created compound value** built a library of capabilities that can be combined
and extended

## The task advantage

Tasks represent a fundamental shift in how organizations capture and scale
expertise:

**Traditional approach** knowledge stays with individuals, workflows require
manual execution, expertise doesn't scale

**Task-driven approach** best practices become automated workflows, anyone can
execute expert-level processes, organizational capability compounds over time

This is how agent-powered organizations can outperform traditional ones—not
through individual productivity gains, but through systematic knowledge capture
and scaling.

## Task sharing and collaboration

Consider how your tasks could benefit others:

```text
Which of our tasks would be valuable to share with the broader community?
How could we contribute to a library of proven workflows that help other agent builders?
```

This community-driven approach accelerates everyone's learning and capability
development.

## Pro tip for today

After creating your tasks, ask your agent:

```text
Based on the tasks we've built, what patterns do you notice in my work style and priorities?
What types of tasks should we focus on creating next to maximize impact?
```

This helps you identify the highest-leverage areas for continued task
development.
