<Card title="Day 9 challenge" icon="repeat">
  **Goal**: create reusable tasks from successful workflows

**Theme**: community week - workflow optimization and reusability

**Time investment**: ~15 minutes

</Card>

<Note>

We're reworking some things and Agent tasks are available soon!

</Note>

Welcome to Day 9! Over the past two days, you've built custom agents and
sophisticated workflows. Today you'll learn to capture these successes as
**reusable tasks**â€”turning one-time interactions into scalable, repeatable
skills that anyone can use.

Tasks are how agent capabilities evolve from experimental to institutional
knowledge.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Understand the difference between conversations and tasks
- Use the Create Task button to automatically generate reusable workflows
- Edit and refine auto-generated task prompts
- Experience how tasks transform agent utility

<Warning>
  This builds on Days 7-8's agent creation and workflow development. You'll need
  the custom agent and workflows you've built to complete today's activities.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding tasks vs. conversations

Before creating tasks, understand what makes them powerful:

**Conversations** are exploratory and unique:

- One-time problem solving
- Iterative refinement and discovery
- Learning and experimentation
- Context-specific solutions

**Tasks** are structured and repeatable:

- Standardized workflows
- Consistent outputs
- Scalable across users and scenarios
- Institutional knowledge capture

<Tip>
  **The task mindset** think about which workflows would be valuable if someone
  else could execute them without needing to understand all the context and
  iteration that went into creating them.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Identify task-worthy workflows

Look for conversations that have these characteristics:

**Clear workflow patterns:**

- Multi-step processes that worked well
- Consistent input/output structures
- Logical sequences that could be repeated
- Successful outcomes worth replicating

**High reusability potential:**

- Processes you'll need again with different inputs
- Workflows that could benefit other team members
- Patterns that work across different scenarios

### Common task patterns

**Research and analysis workflows:**

- Market research with standardized reporting
- Competitive analysis with consistent frameworks
- Customer feedback analysis and insights

**Automation workflows:**

- Meeting preparation with agenda and research
- Project status reporting across tools
- Content creation and distribution processes

## Step 3: using the create task button

After completing a successful workflow with your agent, look for the **Create
Task** button in the bottom left of your interface.

### How the create task button works

1. **Click the Create Task button** in the bottom left after a successful
   workflow
2. **Hypermode analyzes your conversation** to identify repeatable patterns
3. **Auto-generates a task prompt** that captures the workflow essence
4. **You can edit and refine** the generated prompt before saving

### The automatic analysis process

When you click Create Task, Hypermode:

- **Identifies the core workflow** from your conversation
- **Extracts key parameters** that could be customized
- **Generates a structured prompt** that preserves the successful pattern
- **Suggests a task name and description** based on the workflow

### Editing your task prompt

The auto-generated prompt appears for you to review and refine:

![Create Task Interface](/images/agents/create-task-1.png)

**You can edit:**

- Task name and description for clarity
- Prompt instructions to add specificity
- Parameter definitions for customization
- Output format requirements

<Info>
  The Create Task button uses AI to automatically identify reusable patterns and
  generate prompts, but you have full control to refine and perfect the task
  before saving.
</Info>

## Step 4: Using your saved tasks

Once you've refined and saved your task, it becomes available as a reusable
workflow:

### How saved tasks work

- **Task pills** appear proceeding the chat interface
- **Click any task** to invoke it with new parameters
- **Provide new inputs** while maintaining the proven workflow structure
- **Get consistent outputs** that follow the pattern you established

### Testing your task

Click on your newly created task and test it with different inputs to ensure it
works reliably across various scenarios.

## What you've accomplished

In 15 minutes, you've mastered the task creation workflow:

**Automated workflow capture** used the Create Task button to automatically
identify and capture successful patterns

**Prompt refinement skills** learned to edit auto-generated prompts for maximum
effectiveness

**Scalable productivity** created tasks that others can execute with one-click
invocation

**Quality control** developed the ability to refine AI-generated task prompts
for better outcomes

**Institutional knowledge creation** transformed individual expertise into
repeatable organizational capabilities

## The power of automated task creation

The Create Task button represents a breakthrough in knowledge capture:

**Traditional approach**: manually document processes, hope people follow them,
lose institutional knowledge when people leave

**Automated approach**: one-click capture of successful workflows, AI-generated
prompts that preserve expertise, instant availability for team reuse

This is how modern organizations can scale expertise without losing the nuance
of what actually works.

## Pro tip for today

After creating several tasks using the Create Task button:

**Look for task improvement opportunities:**

- Which auto-generated prompts needed the most editing?
- What patterns make tasks more reliable and useful?
- How can you structure conversations to generate better auto-tasks?

This helps you become more effective at both conducting task-worthy workflows
and refining the results.

**Time to complete**: ~15 minutes

**Skills learned**: automated task creation, prompt refinement, workflow pattern
recognition, one-click task invocation

**Next**: day 10 - Week 2 reflection and strategic planning

<Tip>
  **Remember** the Create Task button is your bridge from successful
  conversations to scalable business assets. Every refined workflow becomes a
  one-click capability for your entire team.
