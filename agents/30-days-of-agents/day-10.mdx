<Card title="Day 10 Achievement" icon="trophy">
  **Goal**: celebrate your builder transformation and connect with the community

**Theme**: community week completion - builder identity formed

**Time investment**: ~10 minutes

</Card>

Congratulations! You've completed Week 2 and achieved something
remarkableâ€”you're now an **agent builder**. In just 10 days, you've gone from
exploring agent interfaces to creating custom agents that solve real problems.

This transformation puts you in an exclusive group of people who build with AI
rather than just use it.

## Your 10-day transformation

### Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-5)

- **Day 1**: Explored Sidekick's capabilities and agent thinking
- **Day 2**: Connected calendar and experienced real productivity
- **Day 3**: Automated stand-up generation with calendar intelligence
- **Day 4**: Built predictive workflows with contextual insights
- **Day 5**: Understood the agent mindset shift

### Week 2: Builder development (Days 6-10)

- **Day 6**: Unlocked Pro and met Concierge
- **Day 7**: **Completed the iterative design challenge** - worked with
  Concierge from problem to deployed agent
- **Day 8**: **Mastered connections** - configured sophisticated multi-step
  workflows
- **Day 9**: **Created reusable tasks** - captured successful patterns
  automatically
- **Day 10**: **Builder identity formed** - you now think like someone who
  builds agent solutions

## The builder difference

**Most people** Use AI to generate content or answer questions

**You now** Create agent-powered solutions that automate workflows and solve
business problems

**Before**: "Can AI help us with this task?" **After**: "How can we build an
agent system that handles this entire workflow?"

This isn't just a skill upgradeâ€”it's a fundamental shift in how you approach
work and problem-solving.

## Week 3 preview: Advanced orchestration

The next level of agent development is coming soon:

**Multi-agent workflows** Agents that work together on complex projects
**Production deployment** Enterprise-grade systems with monitoring **Advanced
automation** Sophisticated business process automation

Your Week 2 foundationâ€”custom agent creation, connection mastery, and task
automationâ€”makes you ready for these additional capabilities.

## Keep building

While you wait for Week 3, continue experimenting:

**Try this with your deployed agent:**

```text
What are some creative ways you could use your current connections to solve
problems I haven't thought of yet? Show me what's possible.
```

**Build more agents:**

- Use Concierge to create agents for different domains
- Experiment with various connection combinations
- Share interesting workflows with the community

**Capture more tasks:**

- Use the Create Task button on successful workflows
- Build a library of reusable capabilities
- Think about organizational impact

## The compound effect

Your agent builder capabilities can compound rapidly:

- Each new agent teaches you more about workflow design
- Each connection mastered opens new automation possibilities
- Each task created becomes a reusable organizational asset
- Each community interaction accelerates your learning

You're not just learning a toolâ€”you're developing a new way to work that can
become increasingly valuable as AI becomes central to all knowledge work.
