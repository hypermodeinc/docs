Are you curious about AI agents but not sure where to start? Tired of repetitive
business tasks that eat up your day? Bored of doing the same mundane work over
and over?

**This is your calling.**

Join us and the broader community for **Agents Bootcamp** - a structured journey
that transforms you from AI curious to agent builder. In just 30 days, you'll
create sophisticated agents that integrate with your tools, reason through
complex problems, and deliver real business value.

An agent a day keeps the doctor away. No more wondering "what if." No more
manual repetition. Just practical agents that act.

<Note>
  **Currently available Days 1-5** we're launching with the first week (Meet
  Sidekick) to get you started with immediate value. Stay tuned for the
  remaining weeks as we roll out the complete 30-day program.
