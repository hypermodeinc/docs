![Agents Bootcamp: level up your agent skills in 30 days - Week 1](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/bootcamp-week-1.png)

Are you curious about AI agents but not sure where to start? Tired of repetitive
business tasks that eat up your day? Bored of doing the same mundane work over
and over?

**This is your calling.**

Join us and the broader community for **Agents Bootcamp** - a structured journey
that transforms you from AI curious to agent builder. In just 30 days, you'll
create sophisticated agents that integrate with your tools, reason through
complex problems, and deliver real business value.

An agent a day keeps the doctor away. No more wondering "what if." No more
manual repetition. Just practical agents that act.

<Note>
  **Days 1-10 now available** we've completed the first two weeks with
  foundation building and custom agent creation. The remaining weeks are coming
  soon as we roll out the complete 30-day program with advanced orchestration
  and production deployment strategies.
