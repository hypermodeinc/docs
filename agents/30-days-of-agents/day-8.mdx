<Card title="Day 8 challenge" icon="link">
  **Goal**: build sophisticated multi-step workflows with advanced connections

**Theme**: community week - integration mastery

**Time investment**: ~20 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 8! Yesterday you created your first custom agent with Concierge.
Today we're diving deep into **connections**â€”the integration ecosystem that
transforms simple agents into powerful workflow orchestrators. You'll learn to
connect specialized tools and build agents that handle complex, multi-step
business processes.

This is where agents evolve from helpful assistants to business-critical
automation.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Configure your deployed agent with the right connections
- Master the agent configuration interface and customization options
- Understand connection authorization flow and management
- Explore your agent's capabilities with its new connections
- Learn to iterate on agent instructions and model selection

<Warning>
  This builds on Day 7's agent creation. You'll need the custom agent you
  deployed yesterday to complete today's configuration and workflow development.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Explore your agent's configuration interface

Your agent from yesterday is now deployed in your sidebar, but let's dive into
its configuration options. The agent interface gives you powerful customization
capabilities.

<img
  className="w-1/2 mx-auto"
  src="/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day-8-agent-about.png"
  alt="Agent About View"
/>

**Access your agent's configuration:**

1. **Click on your agent** in the sidebar to open its thread view
2. **Click the agent's name** at the top to access the "About" section
3. **Review the agent details** including its description, instructions, and
   current model

**Key configuration options available:**

- **Agent Instructions**: Edit the system prompt that guides your agent's
  behavior
- **Model Selection**: Currently set to GPT-4.1 (default), but you can
  experiment with other models
- **Agent Description**: Update how your agent presents itself
- **Connection Management**: Add and configure the tools your agent can use

<Tip>
  **Customization power**: you have full control over your agent's instructions
  and model. GPT-4.1 is the default and works great for most use cases, but you
  can experiment with different models or collaborate with us on Discord to find
  what works best for your specific needs.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Add connections through the agent interface

Now let's give your agent the tools it needs to take real actions. The
connections interface makes this straightforward.

<img
  className="w-1/2 mx-auto"
  src="/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day-8-agent-connections.png"
  alt="Agent Connections View"
/>

**Configure connections via agent interface:**

1. **Navigate to the Connections tab** in your agent's about section
2. **Browse available connections** or search for specific tools your agent
   might need
3. **Click "Add Connection"** for tools that align with your agent's purpose
4. **Complete the OAuth flow** when prompted for authentication
5. **Verify successful connection** with the green checkmark indicator

**Connection selection strategy:**

Think about what your agent was designed to do (from Day 7) and add connections
that support those capabilities. For example:

- **Code-related agents**: GitHub, Linear, Vercel
- **Marketing agents**: HubSpot, Google Analytics, Slack
- **Research agents**: Google Drive, Notion, LinkedIn
- **Operations agents**: Google Sheets, Salesforce, Calendar

<Info>
  **Start focused**: add 2-3 connections initially rather than overwhelming your
  agent with too many options. You can always add more as you discover new use
  cases.
</Info>

## Step 3: Alternative connection management options

Besides the agent interface, you have other ways to manage connections across
your workspace.

<img
  className="w-1/2 mx-auto"
  src="/images/agents/connections-sidebar.png"
  alt="Agent Connections View"
/>

**Sidebar connection access:**

- **Click "Add connections"** from the left navigation bar
- **Search through 2,000+ integrations** to find specific tools
- **Complete OAuth flows** directly from the sidebar

![Connections Management](/images/agents/connections-manage.png)

**Workspace-level management:**

1. **Navigate to Workspace Settings** from your profile menu
2. **Click the Connections tab** to see all available integrations
3. **Add connections** that can be shared across multiple agents
4. **Manage authentication status** and review permissions

<Info>
  **Multiple access points**: whether you use the agent interface, sidebar, or
  workspace settings depends on your preference. All methods give you access to
  the same powerful integration ecosystem.
</Info>

## Step 4: Test your agent's new capabilities

Now that your agent has connections, let's explore what it can do. Start with
simple requests to understand how it uses its new tools.

**Test basic connection feature:**

```text
What connections do you have access to now? Can you tell me what you can do with each of them?
```

Your agent can:

- **List available connections** and explain their capabilities
- **Describe potential actions** it can take with each tool
- **Suggest workflows** based on your agent's role and available connections

**Try a simple task:**

```text
Can you help me with [specific task related to your agent's purpose]?
Use whatever connections you think are most appropriate.
```

Watch how your agent:

- **Evaluates available tools** for the task at hand
- **Plans its approach** using the connections you've provided
- **Executes actions** across the integrated platforms
- **Reports results** and suggests next steps

<Tip>
  **Discovery approach**: rather than prescribing specific workflows, let your
  agent show you what's possible. Ask open-ended questions about what it can
  help you accomplish with its current connections.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Customize your agent's instructions and model

The configuration interface gives you direct control over your agent's behavior.
You can edit the agent's prompt and experiment with different models right from
the About section.

**Direct customization options:**

1. **Edit Agent Instructions**: Click "Edit" to modify the system prompt that
   guides your agent's behavior
2. **Change Model Selection**: Switch from the default GPT-4.1 to experiment
   with other models
3. **Update Description**: Adjust how your agent presents itself

**When to customize:**

- **Tone adjustments**: Make the agent more formal, casual, technical, or
  business-focused
- **Process preferences**: Specify how the agent should approach tasks
- **Tool usage patterns**: Guide which connections to prioritize
- **Communication style**: Adjust how the agent reports progress and results

**Model experimentation:**

GPT-4.1 is the default and works great for most use cases, but you can
experiment with different models based on your needs. If you're unsure about
optimization, collaborate with us on Discord to find what works best for your
specific requirements.

<Info>
  **Direct control**: unlike other platforms, you have full access to customize
  your agent's instructions and model selection. This gives you complete control
  over behavior and performance.
</Info>

## What you've accomplished

In 20 minutes, you've mastered agent configuration and connection management:

**Interface mastery**: learned to navigate and customize your agent through the
About section, including instructions and model selection

**Connection configuration**: successfully added relevant connections through
multiple access methods - agent interface, sidebar, and workspace settings

**Agent capability exploration**: tested your agent's new abilities and
discovered what's possible with its connected tools

**Direct customization**: learned to edit agent instructions and experiment with
different models for optimal performance

**Optimization awareness**: understand when and how to get community support for
advanced optimization

## The configuration advantage

Today's work establishes the foundation for powerful agent automation:

**Before configuration**: your agent could only provide advice and suggestions
based on its training

**After configuration**: your agent can take real actions, access live data, and
integrate with your actual workflows and business systems

This transformation from "advisor" to "executor" is what makes Hypermode Agents
different from traditional AI assistants.

## Pro tip for today

Now that your agent is configured, spend some time exploring:

```text
What are some creative ways I could use the connections you now have access to?
What would be most valuable for me to automate or streamline in my current work?
```

Let your agent guide you toward discovering workflows that you might not have
considered, based on its understanding of the tools now available.
