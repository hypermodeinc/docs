Welcome to Week 3! You've mastered the fundamentals with Sidekick and built
custom agents with Concierge. Now it's time to **specialize**.

This week focuses on domain-specific agents—AI that understands the nuances of
specific business functions and tools. You'll learn to build agents that don't
just use tools, but truly understand the workflows and best practices of
different domains.

## Choose Your Learning Path

Week 3 offers **specialized domain tracks** based on your role and interests.
You can follow domains that match your work, or complete multiple tracks to
