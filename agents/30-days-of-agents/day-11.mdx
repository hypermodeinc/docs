<Card title="Day 11 challenge" icon="users">
  **Goal**: orchestrate multiple agents to collaborate on a complex workflow

**Theme**: advanced orchestration week - multi-agent coordination

**Time investment**: ~25 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 11 and Week 3! You've mastered individual agent creation and
optimization. Now you'll learn to orchestrate **multiple agents working
together**—combining different specializations to tackle complex projects that
no single agent could handle alone.

This is where agent systems become truly powerful: specialized agents
collaborating like a high-performing team.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Understand multi-agent collaboration patterns and when to use them
- Design a multi-agent workflow with clear delegation and handoffs
- Implement agent-to-agent communication and coordination
- Experience how specialized agents combine their strengths
- Learn to manage complex workflows with multiple moving parts

<Warning>
  This builds on your agent creation skills from Week 2. You'll need at least 2
  custom agents to complete today's collaboration exercises.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding multi-agent patterns

Before building collaborative workflows, understand the key patterns for agent
coordination:

### Sequential collaboration (pipeline)

Agent A completes work → passes results to Agent B → Agent B continues the work

**Example workflow**: Research Agent gathers market data → Analysis Agent
processes insights → Report Agent creates executive summary

### Parallel collaboration (divide and conquer)

Multiple agents work on different aspects of the same project simultaneously

**Example workflow**: Content Agent drafts social posts + Design Agent creates
visuals + Schedule Agent plans distribution timing

### Hierarchical collaboration (manager-worker)

One agent coordinates and delegates while specialized agents execute specific
tasks

**Example workflow**: Project Manager Agent assigns tasks → Technical Agent
handles code reviews + Marketing Agent manages campaigns

### Peer collaboration (consensus building)

Agents contribute different perspectives to reach better decisions

**Example workflow**: Multiple research agents analyze different data sources →
consolidate findings into comprehensive recommendations

<Tip>
  **Choose the right pattern**: Sequential for dependent workflows, parallel for
  independent tasks, hierarchical for complex coordination, peer for
  decision-making.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Design your first multi-agent workflow

Let's create a practical multi-agent workflow. Choose a scenario that requires
multiple specializations:

### Scenario example: Product launch coordination

**Agents needed**:

- Market Research Agent (analyzes competitive landscape)
- Content Creation Agent (develops messaging and materials)
- Campaign Management Agent (coordinates timeline and execution)

**Start by defining the workflow with one of your existing agents**:

```text
I want to design a multi-agent workflow for [your chosen scenario].
I have these agents available: [list your agents and their capabilities].

Can you help me design a collaboration pattern where these agents work together?
Map out the handoffs, dependencies, and coordination points.
```

Watch how your agent:

- Analyzes the strengths of each available agent
- Identifies optimal collaboration patterns
- Maps dependencies and handoff points
- Suggests coordination mechanisms
- Recommends workflow improvements

### Example workflow design:

**Phase 1**: Market Research Agent conducts competitive analysis **Handoff 1**:
Research findings passed to Content Creation Agent **Phase 2**: Content Agent
develops messaging based on research insights **Handoff 2**: Content passed to
Campaign Management Agent **Phase 3**: Campaign Agent coordinates launch
execution using research and content

## Step 3: Implement agent coordination

Now let's put multi-agent collaboration into practice:

**Start with your primary coordinating agent**:

```text
I'm implementing a multi-agent workflow for [your scenario].
You'll be coordinating with [other agent names] to complete this project.

Here's the workflow we designed: [paste your workflow from Step 2]

Let's start with Phase 1. Can you begin the initial work and prepare the handoff to [next agent]?
```

**Key coordination elements to implement**:

- **Clear handoff formats**: Standardize how information passes between agents
- **Status tracking**: Each agent reports progress and completion
- **Quality checkpoints**: Agents verify work before handoffs
- **Feedback loops**: Later agents can request clarification from earlier agents

### Managing the handoff process:

When Agent A completes their work:

1. **Document outputs clearly** for the next agent
2. **Summarize key findings** and recommendations
3. **Flag any dependencies** or requirements for next steps
4. **Provide context** about decisions made during the work

When Agent B receives the handoff:

1. **Confirm understanding** of the inputs and context
2. **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear
3. **Validate assumptions** from the previous agent's work
4. **Proceed with clear acknowledgment** of responsibilities

<Tip>
  **Document everything**: Multi-agent workflows require clear documentation at
  each step. Encourage agents to summarize their work and reasoning for the next
  agent in the chain.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Advanced coordination techniques

As your workflow progresses, implement these advanced coordination patterns:

### Parallel coordination

```text
I need [Agent A] and [Agent B] to work on different aspects of this project simultaneously.

Agent A: Focus on [specific aspect]
Agent B: Focus on [different aspect]

Coordinate your timelines and check in when you've both completed your initial work.
```

### Quality assurance handoffs

```text
Before we move to the next phase, I want [Quality Agent] to review the work from [Previous Agent].

Check for: [specific quality criteria]
Approve or request revisions before we proceed.
```

### Consensus building

```text
I have different perspectives from [Agent A] and [Agent B] on [decision point].

Can you both discuss your reasoning and work toward a consensus recommendation?
[Agent C], please facilitate this discussion and help reach a decision.
```

## Step 5: Monitor and optimize workflows

Multi-agent coordination requires active management:

**Track progress across agents**:

```text
Can each agent provide a status update on their current work?
- What's completed?
- What's in progress?
- Any blockers or dependencies?
- Estimated completion time?
```

**Identify optimization opportunities**:

```text
Based on how this workflow has progressed, what could we optimize?
- Are there unnecessary handoffs?
- Could any work be done in parallel instead of sequential?
- Are agents waiting too long for inputs?
- How can we improve the coordination process?
```

**Document successful patterns**:

```text
This multi-agent workflow worked well. Can you help me document:
- The successful coordination patterns we used
- Key handoff formats that worked effectively
- Quality checkpoints that prevented issues
- Lessons learned for future multi-agent projects
```

## What you've accomplished

In 25 minutes, you've mastered multi-agent orchestration:

**Pattern recognition**: Learned to identify the right collaboration pattern for
different scenarios

**Workflow design**: Created structured multi-agent workflows with clear
dependencies and handoffs

**Coordination implementation**: Successfully orchestrated multiple agents
working together on complex projects

**Quality management**: Implemented checkpoints and feedback loops to ensure
work quality across agent handoffs

**Optimization skills**: Learned to monitor and improve multi-agent workflows
based on performance

## The power of agent collaboration

Multi-agent workflows unlock capabilities that no single agent can achieve:

**Specialized expertise**: Each agent brings deep knowledge in their domain
**Parallel processing**: Multiple aspects of complex projects handled
simultaneously  
**Quality assurance**: Agents can review and improve each other's work
**Scalability**: Add specialized agents as project complexity grows **Fault
tolerance**: If one agent struggles, others can compensate or provide
alternatives

## Pro tip for today

After completing your multi-agent workflow, ask your coordinating agent:

```text
What made this multi-agent collaboration successful? How could we standardize these patterns for future complex projects?
```

This helps you develop reusable coordination templates that make future
multi-agent projects more efficient.
