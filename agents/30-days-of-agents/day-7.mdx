<Card title="Day 7 challenge" icon="robot">
  **Goal**: create your first custom agent with Concierge

**Theme**: community week - custom agent creation

**Time investment**: ~20 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 7! Yesterday you joined the community and unlocked Hypermode Pro.
Today you'll meet **Concierge**—Hypermode's AI agent that builds AI agents. This
is where the magic happens: transforming natural language descriptions into
fully functional agents with access to 2,000+ integrations.

Unlike Sidekick (which is pre-built for productivity), Concierge lets you create
agents tailored to your specific needs and domain expertise.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Meet Concierge and understand how it builds agents
- Explore the Modus framework that powers Hypermode agents
- Create your first custom agent through conversation
- Connect your agent to relevant integrations
- Experience the difference between using agents and building them

<Warning>
  This requires Hypermode Pro access from Day 6. If you don't have your Pro
  access code yet, participate in Discord community events or engage actively in
  the #agent-bootcamp channel.
</Warning>

## Step 1 meet Concierge

Concierge is fundamentally different from Sidekick. While Sidekick is a
productivity agent, Concierge is a meta-agent—an AI that specializes in building
other AIs.

**Start a conversation with Concierge:**

```text
Hi Concierge! I'm on Day 7 of the Agents Bootcamp. I'd like to understand how you build agents and explore what's possible with custom agent creation.
```

![Concierge Introduction - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day7-concierge-intro.png)

Watch how Concierge:

- Explains its role as an agent builder
- Describes the types of agents it can create
- Walks through the agent creation process
- Connects agent capabilities to business problems

<Tip>
  **Agent builder mindset** notice how Concierge thinks about agent creation— it
  starts with understanding your domain and needs, then maps those to specific
  capabilities and integrations.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Explore the Modus framework

Before building your agent, let's understand the foundation. Ask Concierge to
explore the Modus framework:

```text
Can you explore the Hypermode Modus repository on GitHub?
I'd like to understand the framework that powers Hypermode agents and see what capabilities are available.
```

![Modus Framework Exploration - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day7-modus-exploration.png)

Concierge can:

- Access the Hypermode/Modus GitHub repository
- Explain the open source framework architecture
- Show you key components and capabilities
- Demonstrate how agents are structured and deployed

**Key insights you'll discover:**

- **Open source foundation**: Modus is open source, meaning no vendor lock-in
- **Production-ready**: Built for real applications, not just prototypes
- **Model Context Protocol**: How agents interact with tools and data
- **Serverless architecture**: Scales automatically and costs nothing when idle

## Step 3: Design your first custom agent

Now for the exciting part—designing an agent for your specific needs. Consider
these approaches:

### Option A: Domain expertise agent

If you have specific professional knowledge:

```text
I want to create an agent that helps with [your domain - e.g., financial planning, content marketing, project management].

Here's what I do: [brief description of your work]
Here's what takes too much time: [specific pain points]
Here's what I'd want an agent to handle: [specific tasks]

Can you help me design an agent for this?
```

### Option B: Workflow automation agent

If you have repetitive processes:

```text
I have a workflow that I repeat weekly: [describe your process]

The steps are:
1. [first step]
2. [second step]
3. [third step]

Can you help me create an agent that automates this workflow?
```

### Option c learning agent

If you want to explore capabilities:

```text
I want to build an agent that showcases Hypermode's capabilities.
Something that uses multiple integrations and demonstrates sophisticated reasoning.
What would you recommend?
```

## Step 4: Build your agent with Concierge

Follow Concierge's guided process to create your agent:

### Define the agent's role

Concierge can help you specify:

- **Identity**: What kind of expert is your agent?
- **Capabilities**: What can it do for users?
- **Scope**: What are its boundaries and limitations?
- **Communication style**: How should it interact with users?

### Select relevant integrations

Based on your agent's role, Concierge can recommend integrations from the 2,000+
available:

**Popular integration categories:**

- **Productivity**: Google Workspace, Notion, Slack, Microsoft Teams
- **Development**: GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear, Vercel
- **Sales & Marketing**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Mailchimp, Stripe
- **Data & Analytics**: Google Analytics, Snowflake, Tableau
- **Communication**: Gmail, Outlook, Discord, Zoom

![Integration Selection - Placeholder](/images/agents/30-days-of-agents/day7-integration-selection.png)

### Configure agent behavior

Concierge can create:

- **System instructions**: The core prompt that guides agent behavior
- **Connection permissions**: Which tools the agent can access
- **Response formatting**: How the agent structures its outputs
- **Safety guardrails**: Boundaries and limitations for safe operation

<Info>
  Concierge follows best practices for agent design, including clear role
  definition, appropriate tool selection, and robust safety measures.
</Info>

## Step 5: Test your custom agent

Once Concierge creates your agent, it appears in your left sidebar. Start a
conversation:

```text
Hi [Agent Name]! This is our first conversation. Can you tell me about your capabilities and what connections you have access to?
```

**Test different aspects:**

- **Core capability**: Ask it to perform its primary tasks
- **Integration usage**: Have it use connected tools to complete workflows
- **Reasoning capabilities**: Give it complex, multi-step problems
- **Boundary testing**: Ask it to do things outside its scope

## Step 6: Compare with Sidekick

Now that you have both Sidekick and a custom agent, notice the differences:

**Sidekick (General Productivity)**:

- Pre-built for common productivity tasks
- Optimized for calendar, research, and meeting preparation
- Ready to use immediately
- Broad but focused capabilities

**Your Custom Agent (Domain-Specific)**:

- Tailored to your specific needs and expertise
- Specialized knowledge and vocabulary
- Custom integrations for your workflow
- Narrow but deep capabilities

<Tip>
  **The power of specialization** custom agents excel because they're designed
  for specific contexts. They understand your domain, speak your language, and
  connect to your exact tool stack.
</Tip>

## What you've unlocked

In just 20 minutes, you've:

**Experienced meta-AI** used an AI (Concierge) to build another AI (your custom
agent)

**Understood the framework** explored the open source Modus foundation that
powers your agents

**Created domain expertise** built an agent that understands your specific field
and needs

\*_Connected real tools_ linked your agent to actual services it can use to
complete work

**Learned agent architecture** understood how specialized agents differ from
general-purpose AI

## The Concierge advantage

Unlike other agent builders that require coding or complex configuration,
Concierge:

- **Speaks your language**: No technical jargon or complex setup
- **Understands context**: Maps business needs to technical capabilities
- **Follows best practices**: Creates well-structured, safe, and effective
  agents
- **Scales complexity**: Can build simple task agents or sophisticated
  multi-integration workflows

## Pro tip for today

After creating your agent, ask Concierge:

```text
Based on the agent we just built, what additional integrations or capabilities would make it even more powerful?
What are some advanced use cases I should consider?
```

This helps you understand the trajectory from simple to sophisticated agent
implementations.

<Tip>
  **Remember** You've just moved from agent user to agent builder. The skills
  you're developing—thinking in agent capabilities, mapping workflows to tools,
  and designing domain-specific intelligence—are fundamental to the future of
  work.
