<Card title="Day 13 challenge" icon="database">
  **Goal**: connect your agent to a database and enable data-driven insights

**Theme**: domain specialization week - database intelligence

**Time investment**: ~20 minutes

</Card>

Welcome to Day 13! Today you'll learn how to connect your agents to databases
through Hypermode's connection system. We'll use Neo4j as an example, but the
same approach works for any database‚ÄîSQL, NoSQL, or specialized data stores.

Your agents can query data, analyze patterns, and provide insights without you
needing to write complex queries yourself.

## What you'll accomplish today

- Understand how database connections work in Hypermode
- Connect an agent to a database (Neo4j example)
- See how agents translate questions into queries
- Get insights from your data through natural language
- Learn the pattern for building data-driven agents

<Warning>
  This builds on your Week 2 agent creation skills. For today's example, you can
  use any available database connection or follow along conceptually.
</Warning>

## Step 1: How database connections work

Hypermode agents can connect to virtually any database:

### Supported databases include

- **SQL databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server
- **NoSQL stores**: MongoDB, DynamoDB
- **Graph databases**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune
- **Data warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery
- **Time-series**: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB

### Connection process

1. **Add connection** from Hypermode's connection library
2. **Authenticate securely** with credentials stored encrypted
3. **Assign to your agent** through the connections panel
4. **Start asking questions** in natural language

<Tip>
  **No query language needed**: Your agent translates your business questions
  into the appropriate database queries automatically.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Create a data analysis agent

Let's build an agent that can analyze customer data:

**Start with Concierge:**

```text
I want to create a data analysis agent that connects to our customer database to answer business questions and provide insights.

The agent should understand our business context and help me analyze customer patterns, identify opportunities, and track important metrics.
```

### Simple agent setup

Your agent needs:

- **Database connection** (Neo4j in this example)
- **Business context** about what the data represents
- **Clear instructions** to provide insights, not just raw data

## Step 3: Connect and query naturally

Once connected, you can ask business questions directly:

### Example 1: Customer insights

```text
You: Who are our most valuable customers?

Agent: I'll analyze the customer data to identify your most valuable customers.

Based on the database analysis, here are your top customers:

**Top 5 Most Valuable Customers:**
1. **TechCorp Solutions** - $487K annual revenue, 47 referrals
2. **FinanceFlow Inc** - $398K annual revenue, active for 3 years
3. **GlobalTech Ventures** - $342K annual revenue, expanding rapidly
4. **DataDynamics LLC** - $289K annual revenue, 23 team members
5. **CloudFirst Systems** - $234K annual revenue, high engagement

**Key Insight**: Your top 5 customers represent 23% of total revenue and have referred 134 other customers. Focus retention efforts here.
```

### Example 2: Pattern detection

```text
You: Are there any concerning trends I should know about?

Agent: I've identified some patterns that need attention:

**‚ö†Ô∏è Concerning Trends:**

1. **Reduced Activity in Enterprise Segment**
   - 34% of enterprise customers haven't logged in this month
   - This segment typically drives 45% of revenue

2. **Referral Rate Declining**
   - New customer referrals down 23% from last quarter
   - Top referrers showing less activity

**Recommendations:**
- Reach out to dormant enterprise accounts this week
- Re-engage your top 10 referrers with incentives
- Consider a customer health check campaign

Would you like me to identify specific customers for outreach?
```

### Example 3: Opportunity discovery

```text
You: What growth opportunities do you see in our data?

Agent: I've found several growth opportunities in your customer data:

**üéØ Growth Opportunities:**

1. **Upsell Potential**
   - 67 customers hitting usage limits
   - Estimated revenue opportunity: $34K/month

2. **Untapped Networks**
   - 23 highly satisfied customers with no referrals yet
   - Each typically could bring 3-5 new customers

3. **Re-engagement Wins**
   - 45 previously active accounts went dormant
   - Historical win-back rate: 35% with targeted outreach

**Quick Win**: Send upgrade offers to the 67 customers hitting limits. Based on past campaigns, expect 40% conversion.
```

## Step 4: Building data-driven workflows

Your database-connected agent can automate regular analysis:

### Weekly business intelligence

```text
You: Can you give me our weekly business metrics summary?

Agent: Here's your weekly business intelligence summary:

**Week of March 10-16, 2024**

üìà **Growth Metrics:**
- New customers: 34 (+12% vs last week)
- Revenue: $487K (+8% vs last week)
- Active users: 1,247 (+5%)

üìä **Customer Health:**
- Engagement score: 78/100 (stable)
- Support tickets: 23 (-15% - good!)
- Feature adoption: 67% (+3%)

üéØ **Action Items:**
- 12 trial accounts ready for conversion outreach
- 5 customers need check-ins (low activity alerts)
- 3 upsell opportunities identified

Would you like details on any of these metrics?
```

## What you've accomplished

In 20 minutes, you've learned how to:

**Connect databases**: Enable agents to access your business data securely

**Natural language queries**: Ask questions without writing complex database
queries

**Get insights, not just data**: Agents interpret results and provide
recommendations

**Automate analysis**: Set up regular reporting and monitoring through your
agent

**Scale expertise**: Give everyone on your team data analyst capabilities

## The power of database-connected agents

With database connections, your agents can:

- **Democratize data access** - Anyone can get insights without SQL knowledge
- **Proactive monitoring** - Agents watch for important changes and alert you
- **Cross-system analysis** - Connect multiple databases for complete pictures
- **Automated reporting** - Regular insights without manual work
