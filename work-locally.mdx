Building Modus apps is even easier when you add Hypermode. The Hyp CLI extends
the [local Modus experience](/modus/modus-cli) with access to Hypermode-hosted
models defined in your [app's manifest](/modus/app-manifest) for rapid
experimentation with new AI models.

## Hyp CLI setup

1. First, install the Hyp CLI to augment Modus:

   <CodeGroup>

   ```bash MacOS + Linux
   curl -sSL http://install.hypermode.com/hyp.sh | bash
   ```

   ```js Windows
   npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli
   ```

   </CodeGroup>

2. Ensure you're logged in to the Hyp CLI with the `hyp login` command.

3. Run `modus dev` to run your Modus app locally.
