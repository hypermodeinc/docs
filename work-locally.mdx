Building Modus apps is even easier when you add Hypermode. The Hyp CLI extends
the [local Modus experience](/modus/modus-cli) with access to Hypermode-hosted
models defined in your [app's manifest](/modus/app-manifest) for rapid
experimentation with new AI models.

## Hyp CLI setup

For access to hosted models, install the Hyp CLI to augment Modus.

```bash
npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli
```

## Log into Hyp

Before running `modus dev` to run your Modus app locally, ensure you're logged
into the Hyp CLI with the `hyp login` command.
