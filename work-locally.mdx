By using the Hyp CLI, you can access Hypermode-hosted models defined in your
[app's manifest](/modus/app-manifest). This allows for seamless and rapid
experimentation with new AI models.

## Hyp CLI setup

The Hyp CLI helps you manage your Hypermode projects. You can install the Hyp
CLI to augment Modus and access your Hypermode-hosted models locally.
