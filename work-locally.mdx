Building Modus apps is even easier when you add Hypermode. The Hyp CLI extends the
[local Modus experience](/modus/modus-cli) with access to Hypermode-hosted models defined in your
[app's manifest](/modus/app-manifest) for rapid experimentation with new AI models.

## Hyp CLI setup

For access to hosted models, install the Hyp CLI to augment Modus.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -sSL https://install.hypermode.com/hyp.sh | bash
```

```js npm
npm install -g @hypermode/hyp
```

</CodeGroup>

## Log into Hyp

Before running `modus dev` to run your Modus app locally, ensure you're logged into the Hyp CLI with
the `hyp login` command.
