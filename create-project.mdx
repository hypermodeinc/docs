This section walks you through the process of setting up a new project using Hypermode's toolchain, from installation to deployment.

<Note>
  A Modus app and the Hypermode CLI are required to create a project. To create
  a Modus app, see the [Modus Docs](/modus/quickstart).
</Note>

### Hypermode CLI

1. **Install the Hypermode CLI**
   First install the Hypermode CLI to deploy your Modus app to Hypermode:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash MacOS 
  brew install hypermode
  ```

```bash Windows
TODO:
```

```bash
Linux TODO:
```

</CodeGroup>

2. **Authenticate**
   Sign up or log in to authenticate:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Signup
hyp signup
```

```bash Login
hyp login
```

</CodeGroup>

3. **Initialize the project**
   To build and prepare your Modus app for the Hypermode Platform, run:

```bash
hyp init
```

This command adds a default GitHub Action to build and deploy your Hypermode functions, along with importing any additional configuration files.

4. **Push app to GitHub**
   Push your app to GitHub to initiate the deployment.

5. **View your project** Find your project by signing in to the [Hypermode Platform](hypermode.com/sign-in).

#### Alternatively:

If youâ€™re starting from the Hypermode Platform instead of the CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create an account**  
   Visit the [Hypermode Sign-Up Page](http://hypermode.com/sign-up) to create an account and an organization.

2. **Access your organization home**  
   After signing up, navigate to the [Organization Home](http://hypermode.com/go) to view and manage your organization.

3. **Create a new project**  
   From the organization home, create a new project by clicking [New Project](http://hypermode.com/new). Provide the project name, description, and select your language or runtime (e.g., AS/Go).

4. **Sync your project**
   When initializng your project from the Hypermode CLI, select your existing project to sync to your Modus app.
