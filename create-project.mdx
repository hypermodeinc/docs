This section walks you through the process of setting up a new project using Hypermode's toolchain, from installation to deployment.

<Note>
  A Modus app and the Hypermode CLI are required to create a project. To create
  a Modus app, see the [Modus Docs](/modus/quickstart).
</Note>

### Hypermode CLI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Hypermode CLI">
    First install the Hypermode CLI to deploy your Modus app to Hypermode:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash MacOS 
    brew install hypermode
    ```

```bash Windows
TODO:
```

```bash
Linux TODO:
```

  </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
   Sign up or log in to authenticate:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Signup
    hyp signup
    ```

    ```bash Login
    hyp login
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
<Step title="Initialize the project">
   To build and prepare your Modus app for the Hypermode Platform, run:

```bash
hyp init
```

This command adds a default GitHub Action to build and deploy your Hypermode functions, along with importing any additional configuration files.

</Step>
<Step title="Push app to GitHub">
   Push your app to GitHub to initiate the deployment.
</Step>
<Step title="View your project"> 
Find your project by signing in to the [Hypermode Platform](hypermode.com/sign-in).
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Alternatively:

If youâ€™re starting from the Hypermode Platform instead of the CLI, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Visit the [Hypermode Sign-Up Page](http://hypermode.com/sign-up) to create
    an account and an organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access your organization home">
    After signing up, navigate to the [Organization
    Home](http://hypermode.com/go) to view and manage your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new project">
    From the organization home, create a new project by clicking [New
    Project](http://hypermode.com/new). Provide the project name, description,
    and select your language or runtime (e.g., AS/Go).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync your project">
    When initializng your project from the Hypermode CLI, select your existing
    project to sync to your Modus app.
  </Step>
</Steps>
