A Hypermode project represents your Modus app and associated models. You can create a project through the Hypermode Console or Hyp CLI.

## Create with Hypermode Console

<Note>
  Hypermode relies on git as a source for project deployment. Through the
  project creation flow, you'll connect Hypermode to your GitHub account.
</Note>

From your organization home, click **New Project**. Set a name for the project and click **Create**.

Once you have created a project, Hypermode prompts you to import the repo with your Modus app. To create your first Modus app, see the [Modus quickstart](modus/quickstart).

## Import with Hyp CLI

After you have created your Modus app, you can initialize the app with Hypermode through the Hyp CLI. To initialize your Hypermode project, run

```bash
hyp init
```

This command adds a default GitHub Actions workflow to build your Modus app and a Hypermode GitHub app for auto-deployment. Once initialized, each commit to the target branch triggers a deployment.
