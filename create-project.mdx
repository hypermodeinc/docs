description: "Initialize your Modus app with Hypermode"
---

A Hypermode project represents your Modus app and associated models. You can
create a project through the Hypermode Console or Hyp CLI.

## Create with Hypermode Console

<Note>
  Hypermode relies on Git as a source for project deployment. Through the
  project creation flow, you'll connect Hypermode to your GitHub account.
</Note>

From your organization home, click **New Project**. Set a name for the project
and click **Create**.

Once you have created a project, Hypermode prompts you to finish setting up your
project using the CLI.

First, install the Modus CLI and initialize your app. For more information on
creating your first Modus app, visit the
[Modus quickstart](modus/first-modus-agent).

Next, initialize the app with Hypermode through the [Hyp CLI](/hyp-cli) and link
your GitHub repo with your Modus app to Hypermode using:

```sh
hyp link
```

This command adds a default GitHub Actions workflow to build your Modus app and
a Hypermode GitHub app for auto-deployment. Once initialized, each commit to the
target branch triggers a deployment.

You can also connect to an existing GitHub repository.

The last step is triggering your first deployment. If you linked your project
through the Hyp CLI, make sure to push your changes first to trigger a
deployment.
