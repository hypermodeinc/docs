Each project within Hypermode includes its own GraphQL endpoint, configuration settings, and data store.

- **Project Endpoint**: A project's endpoint is structured as `<project-slug>-<org-slug>.hypermode.app`. This unique endpoint allows you to interact with your project's data and functionality by hitting `/graphql`. For more details on integrating with the API, see [Integrate API](/integrate-api).

### Steps to Create a New Project

1. **Select an Organization**  
   To create a new project, navigate to the top-level navigation bar and select the organization under which the project will be created.

   - **Empty State**: If your organization does not have any projects yet, click the "Create a Project" button in the empty state section of the page.
   - **Existing Organizations**: For organizations with existing projects, use the "New Project" button located on the right side of the organization’s dashboard.

2. **Choose a Template**  
   Select a template that best matches your use case or start with a base template to configure your project from scratch. Available options include:

   - **Predefined Templates**: Ready-to-use configurations for common scenarios, providing a quick start.
   - **Expert Template**: A more advanced configuration option, allowing customization of data sources and structure.
   - **Modus Git Repository Import**: Import a Modus-based Git repository to integrate with your existing project workflows.

   > **Note**: If you select the Expert template, you have the option to populate the data store with sample data or upload your own custom data with a .csv file after the project is created.

3. **Deploy the Project**  
   After choosing a template or importing a repository, click the **Deploy** button. This action initiates the deployment process, setting up your project's endpoint and configurations based on the selected template.

### Next Steps

Once the deployment process is complete, you can:

- Access the project’s GraphQL endpoint at `<project-slug>-<org-slug>@hypermode.app/graphql`.
- Configure additional project settings.
- Begin integrating with your project's API by following the steps outlined in the [Integrate API](/integrate-api) section.
