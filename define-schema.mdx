A GraphQL schema is code first generated from the exported functions in the `index.ts` file located under `functions / assembly` folder of you project.

When deployed, your GraphQL API enpoint is available on the `/graphql` path from your project's endpoint.
The project's endpoint is visible in the Hypermode Console on the Project Home screen.

For example, with the following index.ts file:

```ts
import { inference } from "@hypermode/functions-as";

export function testClassifier(text: string): string {
  const modelName = "sentiment-classifier";
  const threshold: f32 = 0.5;
  return inference.classifyText(modelName, text, threshold);
}
```

The GraphQL endpoint will serve the following GraphQL Schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  testClassifier(text: String!): String!
}
```

The GraphQL API endpoint supports introspection.
You can visualize the generated GraphQL Schema, using the query builder `Docs` tab in the Hypermode Console .
