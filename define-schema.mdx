title: GraphQL API
description: "Create the signature for your API"

A GraphQL schema is code first generated from the exported functions in the `index.ts` file located under `functions / assembly` folder of you project.

When deployed, your GraphQL API is available on the `/graphql` path from your project's endpoint.


For example, with the following index.ts file:
```ts
import { inference } from "@hypermode/functions-as";

export function testClassifier(text: string): string {
  const modelName = "sentiment-classifier";
  const threshold: f32 = 0.5;
  return inference.classifyText(modelName, text, threshold);
}
```
The deployment will generate a GraphQL Schema 

```graphql
type Query {
  testClassifier(text: String!): String! 
}
```

The endpoint is visible in the Hypermode Console on the Project Home screen.
