title: Define Schema

<Warning>A new approach for schema definition is currently being developed. Expect this to be simplified in the next few weeks. Feedback welcomed!</Warning>

The schema exposes functions on your project's API endpoint. It is defined in a `schema.graphql` file in your project.

```graphql schema.graphql
directive @hm_function on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
   classifySentiment(text: String!): String! @lambda @hm_function
   classifySeverity(text: String!): String! @lambda @hm_function
}
```

Hypermode follows [GraphQL's standard definition language](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/). Add your function signature and the [directive](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives) `@lambda @hm_function` to register the function on the project's endpoint. The signature must match the exposed function in your `index.ts` file.

When deployed, your GraphQL API will be available on the `/graphql` path from your project's endpoint. The endpoint is listed in the Hypermode Console on the Project Home screen.
