A Dgraph `Namespace` (or tenant) is a logical separation for data within a
Dgraph cluster. A Dgraph cluster can host many Namespaces. Each user must then
into their own namespace using namespace-specific own credentials, and sees only
their own data. Note that this usually requires an extra or specific login.

There is no mechanism to query in a way that combines data from two namespaces,
which simplifies and enforces security in use cases where this is the
requirement. An API layer or client would have to pull data from multiple
namespaces using different authenticated queries if data needed to be combined.
