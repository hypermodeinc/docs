<DgraphWIP />

In setting up a cluster be sure the check the following.

- Is at least one Dgraph Zero node running?
- Is each Dgraph Alpha instance in the cluster set up correctly?
- Will each Dgraph Alpha instance be accessible to all peers on 7080 (+ any port
  offset)?
- Does each instance have a unique ID on startup?
- Has `--bindall=true` been set for networked communication?

See the [Production Checklist](./production-checklist) docs for more info.
