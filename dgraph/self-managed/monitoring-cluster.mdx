## Monitoring the Kubernetes cluster

Dgraph exposes Prometheus metrics to monitor the state of various components
involved in the cluster, including Dgraph Alpha and Zero nodes. You can setup
Prometheus monitoring for your cluster.

You can use Helm to install
[kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus)
chart. This Helm chart is a collection of Kubernetes manifests,
[Grafana](http://grafana.com/) dashboards,
[Prometheus rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/)
combined with scripts to provide monitoring with
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) using the
[Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).
This Helm chart also installs [Grafana](http://grafana.com/),
[node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter),
[kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics).

### Before you begin

- Install the
  [Kubernetes command line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
- Ensure that you have a production-ready Kubernetes cluster with at least three
  worker nodes running in a cloud provider of your choice.
- Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

### Install using Helm chart

1. Create a `YAML` file named `dgraph-prometheus-operator.yaml` and edit the
   values as appropriate for adding endpoints, adding alert rules, adjusting
   alert manager configuration, adding Grafana dashboard, and others. For more
   information see,
   [Dgraph Helm chart values](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/tree/master/contrib/config/monitoring/prometheus/chart-values).

   ```yaml
   prometheusOperator:
     createCustomResource: true

   grafana:
     enabled: true
     persistence:
       enabled: true
       accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
       size: 5Gi
     defaultDashboardsEnabled: true
     service:
       type: ClusterIP

   alertmanager:

         group_interval: 5m
         repeat_interval: 12h
         receiver: 'null'
         routes:
         - match:
             alertname: Watchdog
              receiver: 'null'
       receivers:
       - name: 'null'

   prometheus:
     service:
         type: ClusterIP
     serviceAccount:
       create: true
       name: prometheus-dgraph-io

     prometheusSpec:
       storageSpec:
         volumeClaimTemplate:
           spec:

             resources:
               requests:
                 storage: 25Gi
       resources:
         requests:
           memory: 400Mi
       enableAdminAPI: false

     additionalServiceMonitors:
       - name: zero-dgraph-io
         endpoints:
           - port: http-zero
             path: /debug/prometheus_metrics
         namespaceSelector:
           any: true
         selector:
           matchLabels:
             monitor: zero-dgraph-io
       - name: alpha-dgraph-io
         endpoints:
           - port: http-alpha
             path: /debug/prometheus_metrics
         namespaceSelector:
           any: true
         selector:
           matchLabels:
             monitor: alpha-dgraph-io
   ```

2. Create a `YAML` file named `secrets.yaml` that has the credentials for
   Grafana.

   ```yaml
   grafana:
     adminPassword: <GRAFANA-PASSWORD>
   ```

3. Add the `prometheus-operator` Helm chart:

   ```sh
   helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
   helm repo update
   ```

4. Install
   [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus)
   with the `<MY-RELEASE-NAME>` in the namespace named `monitoring`:

   ```sh
   helm install <MY-RELEASE-NAME>\
     --values dgraph-prometheus-operator.yaml \
     --values secrets.yaml \
     prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring
   ```

   An output similar to the following appears:

   ```sh
   NAME: dgraph-prometheus-release
   LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Feb  5 21:35:45 2023
   NAMESPACE: monitoring
   STATUS: deployed
   REVISION: 1
   NOTES:
   kube-prometheus-stack has been installed. Check its status by running:
     kubectl --namespace monitoring get pods -l "release=dgraph-prometheus-release"

   Visit https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus instructions on how to create & configure Alertmanager and Prometheus instances using the Operator.
   ```

5. Check the list of services in the `monitoring` namespace using
   `kubectl get svc -n monitoring`:

   ```sh
   NAME                                                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
   alertmanager-operated                                ClusterIP   None             <none>        9093/TCP,9094/TCP,9094/UDP   29s
   dgraph-prometheus-release-alertmanager               ClusterIP   10.128.239.240   <none>        9093/TCP                     32s
   dgraph-prometheus-release-grafana                    ClusterIP   10.128.213.70    <none>        80/TCP                       32s
   dgraph-prometheus-release-kube-state-metrics         ClusterIP   10.128.139.145   <none>        8080/TCP                     32s
   dgraph-prometheus-release-operator                   ClusterIP   10.128.6.5       <none>        443/TCP                      32s
   dgraph-prometheus-release-prometheus                 ClusterIP   10.128.255.88    <none>        9090/TCP                     32s
   dgraph-prometheus-release-prometheus-node-exporter   ClusterIP   10.128.103.131   <none>        9100/TCP                     32s
   prometheus-operated                                  ClusterIP   None             <none>        9090/TCP                     29s

   ```

6. Use
   `kubectl port-forward svc/dgraph-prometheus-release-prometheus -n monitoring 9090`
   to access Prometheus at `localhost:9090`.
7. Use `kubectl --namespace monitoring port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80` to
   access Grafana at `localhost:3000`.
8. Log in to Grafana using the password that you had set in the `secrets.yaml`
   file.
9. In the **Dashboards** menu of Grafana, select **Import**.
10. In the **Dashboards/Import dashboard** page copy the contents of the
    [`dgraph-kubernetes-grafana-dashboard.json`](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/blob/master/contrib/config/monitoring/grafana/dgraph-kubernetes-grafana-dashboard.json)
    file in **Import via panel JSON** and click **Load**.

    You can visualize all Dgraph Alpha and Zero Kubernetes Pods, using the
    regular expression pattern `"/dgraph-.*-[0-9]*$/`. You can change this in
    the dashboard configuration and select the variable Pod. For example, if you
    have multiple releases, and only want to visualize the current release named
    `my-release-3`, change the regular expression pattern to
    `"/my-release-3.*dgraph-.*-[0-9]*$/"` in the Pod variable of the dashboard
    configuration. By default, the Prometheus that you installed is configured
    as the `Datasource` in Grafana.

## Kubernetes storage

The Kubernetes configurations in the previous sections were configured to run
Dgraph with any storage type (`storage-class: anything`). On the common cloud
environments like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, the default storage type are
slow disks like hard disks or low IOPS SSDs. We highly recommend using faster
disks for ideal performance when running Dgraph.

### Local storage

The AWS storage-optimized i-class instances provide locally attached NVMe-based
SSD storage which provide consistent very high IOPS. The Dgraph team uses
i3.large instances on AWS to test Dgraph.

You can create a Kubernetes `StorageClass` object to provision a specific type
of storage volume which you can then attach to your Dgraph Pods. You can set up
your cluster with local SSDs by using
[Local Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/13/local-persistent-volumes-beta/).
This Kubernetes feature is in beta at the time of this writing (Kubernetes
v1.13.1). You can first set up an EC2 instance with locally attached storage.
Once it's formatted and mounted properly, then you can create a StorageClass to
access it.:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: <your-local-storage-class-name>
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

Currently, Kubernetes doesn't allow automatic provisioning of local storage. So
a PersistentVolume with a specific mount path should be created:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: <your-local-pv-name>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 475Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
  storageClassName: <your-local-storage-class-name>
  local:
    path: /data
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
              operator: In
              values:
                - <node-name>
```

Then, in the StatefulSet configuration you can claim this local storage in
.spec.volumeClaimTemplate:

```yaml
kind: StatefulSet
---
volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: datadir
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      storageClassName: <your-local-storage-class-name>
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 500Gi
```

You can repeat these steps for each instance that's configured with local node
storage.

### Non-local persistent disks

EBS volumes on AWS and PDs on Google Cloud are persistent disks that can be
configured with Dgraph. The disk performance is much lower than locally attached
storage but can be sufficient for your workload such as testing environments.

When using EBS volumes on AWS, we recommend using Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS
volumes (the io1 disk type) which provide consistent IOPS. The available IOPS
for AWS EBS volumes is based on the total disk size. With Kubernetes, you can
request io1 disks to be provisioned with this configuration with 50 IOPS/GB
using the `iopsPerGB` parameter:

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: <your-storage-class-name>
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: io1
  iopsPerGB: "50"
  fsType: ext4
```

Example: requesting a disk size of 250Gi with this storage class would provide
12.5K IOPS.

## Removing a Dgraph pod

In the event that you need to completely remove a Pod (for example, the disk
became corrupted and data can't be recovered), you can use the `/removeNode` API
to remove the node from the cluster. With a Kubernetes StatefulSet, you'll need
to remove the node in this order:

1. On the Zero leader, call `/removeNode` to remove the Dgraph instance from the
   cluster (see [More about Dgraph Zero](/dgraph/self-managed/dgraph-zero)). The
   removed instance will immediately stop running. Any further attempts to join
   the cluster fails for that instance since it has been removed.
2. Remove the PersistentVolumeClaim associated with the Pod to delete its data.
   This prepares the Pod to join with a clean state.
3. Restart the Pod. This creates a new PersistentVolumeClaim to create new data
   directories.

When an Alpha Pod restarts in a replicated cluster, it joins as a new member of
the cluster, be assigned a group and an unused index from Zero, and receive the
latest snapshot from the Alpha leader of the group.

When a Zero Pod restarts, it must join the existing group with an unused index
ID. You set the index ID with the `--raft` superflag's `idx` option. This might
require you to update the StatefulSet configuration.

## Kubernetes and Bulk Loader

You may want to initialize a new cluster with an existing data set such as data
from the [Dgraph Bulk Loader](/dgraph/admin/bulk-loader). You can use
[Init Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)
to copy the data to the Pod volume before the Alpha process runs.

See the `initContainers` configuration in
[dgraph-ha.yaml](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/tree/master/contrib/config/kubernetes/dgraph-ha/dgraph-ha.yaml)
to learn more.
