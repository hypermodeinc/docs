You can deploy and manage Dgraph database in a variety of self-managed
deployment scenarios, including:

- Running Dgraph on your on-premises infrastructure (virtual or bare-metal
  physical servers)
- Running Dgraph on your cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud and Azure)

This section focuses exclusively on deployment and management for these
self-managed scenarios.

## Overview

A Dgraph cluster consists of the following:

- **Dgraph Alpha database server nodes**: The Dgraph Alpha server nodes in your
  deployment host and serve data. These nodes also host an `/admin` HTTP and
  gRPC endpoint that can be used for data and node administration tasks such as
  backup, export, draining, and shutdown.
- **Dgraph Zero management server nodes**: The Dgraph Zero nodes in your
  deployment control the nodes in your Dgraph cluster. Dgraph Zero automatically
  moves data between different Dgraph Alpha instances based on the volume of
  data served by each Alpha instance.

You need at least one node of each type to run Dgraph. You need three nodes of
each type to run Dgraph in a high-availability (HA) cluster configuration. To
learn more about 2-node and 6-node deployment options, see the
[Production Checklist](./production-checklist).

Each Dgraph Alpha exposes various administrative (admin) endpoints both over
HTTP and GraphQL, for example endpoints to export data and to perform a clean
shutdown. All such admin endpoints are protected by three layers of
authentication:

1. IP White-listing (use the `--security` superflag's `whitelist` option on
   Dgraph Alpha to whitelist IP addresses other than localhost).
2. Poor-man's auth, if Dgraph Alpha is started with the `--security` superflag's
   `token` option, then you should pass the token as an `X-Dgraph-AuthToken`
   header while making the HTTP request.
3. Guardian-only access, if Access Control Lists (ACL) is enabled. In this case
   you should pass the ACL-JWT of a Guardian user using the
   `X-Dgraph-AccessToken` header while making the HTTP request.

An administration endpoint is any HTTP endpoint which provides admin
capabilities. Administration endpoints usually start with the `/admin` path. The
current list of admin endpoints includes the following:

- `/admin`
- `/admin/config/cache_mb`
- `/admin/draining`
- `/admin/shutdown`
- `/admin/schema`
- `/admin/schema/validate`
- `/alter`
- `/login`

There are a few exceptions to this general rule:

- `/login`: This endpoint logs-in an ACL user, and provides them with a JWT.
  Only IP Whitelisting and Poor-man's auth checks are performed for this
  endpoint.
- `/admin`: This endpoint provides GraphQL queries/mutations corresponding to
  the HTTP admin endpoints. All of the queries/mutations on `/admin` have all
  three layers of authentication, except for `login (mutation)`, which has the
  same behavior as the HTTP `/login` endpoint.

## Whitelisting admin operations

By default, admin operations can only be initiated from the machine on which the
Dgraph Alpha runs.

You can use the `--security` superflag's `whitelist` option to specify a
comma-separated whitelist of IP addresses, IP ranges, CIDR ranges, or hostnames
for hosts from which admin operations can be initiated.

**IP Address**

```sh
dgraph alpha --security whitelist=127.0.0.1 ...
```

This would allow admin operations from hosts with IP 127.0.0.1 (that's
`localhost` only).

**IP Range**

```sh
dgraph alpha --security whitelist=172.17.0.0:172.20.0.0,192.168.1.1 ...
```

This would allow admin operations from hosts with IP between `172.17.0.0` and
`172.20.0.0` along with the server which has IP address as `192.168.1.1`.

**CIDR Range**

```sh
dgraph alpha --security whitelist=172.17.0.0/16,172.18.0.0/15,172.20.0.0/32,192.168.1.1/32 ...
```

This would allow admin operations from hosts that matches the CIDR range
`172.17.0.0/16`, `172.18.0.0/15`, `172.20.0.0/32`, or `192.168.1.1/32` (the same
range as the IP Range example).

You can set whitelist IP to `0.0.0.0/0` to whitelist all IP addresses.

**Hostname**

```sh
dgraph alpha --security whitelist=admin-bastion,host.docker.internal ...
```

This would allow admin operations from hosts with hostnames `admin-bastion` and
`host.docker.internal`.

## Restrict mutation operations

By default, you can perform mutation operations for any predicate. If the
predicate in mutation doesn't exist in the schema, the predicate gets added to
the schema with an appropriate [Dgraph Type](/dgraph/dql/schema).

You can use `--limit "mutations=disallow"` to disable all mutations, which is
set to `allow` by default.

```sh
dgraph alpha --limit "mutations=disallow;"
```

Enforce a strict schema by setting `--limit "mutations=strict`. This mode allows
mutations only on predicates already in the schema. Before performing a mutation
on a predicate that doesn't exist in the schema, you need to perform an alter
operation with that predicate and its schema type.

```sh
dgraph alpha --limit "mutations=strict; mutations-nquad=1000000"
```

## Secure alter operations

Clients can use alter operations to apply schema updates and drop particular or
all predicates from the database. By default, all clients are allowed to perform
alter operations. You can configure Dgraph to only allow alter operations when
the client provides a specific token. You can use this "Simple ACL" token to
prevent clients from making unintended or accidental schema updates or predicate
drops.

You can specify the auth token with the `--security` superflag's `token` option
for each Dgraph Alpha in the cluster. Clients must include the same auth token
to make alter requests.

```sh
dgraph alpha --security token=<authtokenstring>
```

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/alter -d '{ "drop_all": true }'
# Permission denied. No token provided.
```

```sh
curl -s -H 'X-Dgraph-AuthToken: <wrongsecret>' localhost:8080/alter -d '{ "drop_all": true }'
# Permission denied. Incorrect token.
```

```sh
curl -H 'X-Dgraph-AuthToken: <authtokenstring>' localhost:8080/alter -d '{ "drop_all": true }'
# Success. Token matches.
```

<Note>
  To fully secure alter operations in the cluster, the authentication token must
  be set for every Alpha node.
</Note>

## Export database

As an `Administrator` you might want to export data from Dgraph to:

- backup your data
- migrate your data from one instance to another
- share your data

For more information about exporting your database, see
[Export data](/dgraph/admin/export)

## Shut down database

A clean exit of a single Dgraph node is initiated by running the following
GraphQL mutation on /admin endpoint.

<Warning>
  This won't work if called from outside the server where Dgraph is running. You
  can specify a list or range of whitelisted IP addresses from which shutdown or
  other admin operations can be initiated using the `--security` superflag's
  `whitelist` option on `dgraph alpha`.
</Warning>

```graphql
mutation {
  shutdown {
    response {
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

This stops the Alpha on which the command is executed and not the entire
cluster.

## Delete database

To drop all data, you could send a `DropAll` request via `/alter` endpoint.

Alternatively, you could:

- [Shutdown Dgraph](#shut-down-database) and wait for all writes to complete,
- Delete (maybe do an export first) the `p` and `w` directories, then
- Restart Dgraph.

## Upgrade database

Doing periodic exports is always a good idea. This is particularly useful if you
wish to upgrade Dgraph or reconfigure the sharding of a cluster. The following
are the right steps to safely export and restart.

1. Start an [export](#export-database)
2. Ensure it's successful
3. [Shutdown Dgraph](#shut-down-database) and wait for all writes to complete
4. Start a new Dgraph cluster using new data directories (this can be done by
   passing empty directories to the options `-p` and `-w` for Alphas and `-w`
   for Zeros)
5. Reload the data via [Bulk Loader](/dgraph/admin/bulk-loader)
6. Verify the correctness of the new Dgraph cluster. If all looks good, you can
   delete the old directories (export serves as an insurance)

These steps are necessary because Dgraph's underlying data format could have
changed, and reloading the export avoids encoding incompatibilities.

Blue-green deployment is a common approach to minimize downtime during the
upgrade process. This approach involves switching your app to read-only mode. To
make sure that no mutations are executed during the maintenance window you can
do a rolling restart of all your Alpha using the option `--mutations disallow`
when you restart the Alpha nodes. This ensures the cluster is in read-only mode.

At this point your app can still read from the old cluster and you can perform
steps 4 and 5. When the new cluster (that uses the upgraded version of Dgraph)
is up and running, you can point your app to it, and shutdown the old cluster.

## Post Installation

Now that Dgraph is up and running, to understand how to add and query data to
Dgraph, follow [Query Language Spec](/dgraph/dql/schema).
