import DgraphWIP from "/snippets/dgraph-wip.mdx"

<DgraphWIP />

You modify Dgraph types (node types and predicates types) by

- issuing a request to the `/alter` endpoint using the
  [HTTP Client](/dgraph/http#alter-the-dql-schema)
- using an `alter` operation of any [DQL client library](/dgraph/sdks/overview).
- using [Ratel UI](/dgraph/ratel/schema)
- using the Cloud console through the
  [DQL Schema](https://cloud.dgraph.io/_/schema?tab=dqlschema) tab of the Schema
  section.

### Notes about predicate type change

If data is already stored, existing values aren't checked to conform to the
updated predicate type.

On query, Dgraph tries to convert existing values to the new predicate type and
ignores any that fail conversion.

If data exists and new indexes are specified, any old index not in the updated
schema is dropped. New indexes are created.

## Indexes in background

Indexes may take long time to compute depending upon the size of the data.

Indexes can be computed in the background and thus indexing may still be running
after an Alter operation returns.

To run index computation in the background set the flag `runInBackground` to
`true` .

```sh
curl localhost:8080/alter?runInBackground=true -XPOST -d $'
    name: string @index(fulltext, term) .
    age: int @index(int) @upsert .
    friend: [uid] @count @reverse .
' | python -m json.tool | less
```

```go
op := &api.Operation{}
op.Schema = `
  name: string @index(fulltext, term) .
  age: int @index(int) @upsert .
  friend: [uid] @count @reverse .
`
op.RunInBackground = true
err = dg.Alter(context.Background(), op)
```

### Notes

If executed before the indexing finishes, queries that require the new indices
fail with an error notifying that a given predicate isn't indexed or doesn't
have reverse edges.

In a multi-node cluster, it's possible that the alphas finish computing indexes
at different times. Alphas may return different schema in such a case until all
the indexes are done computing on all the Alphas.

You can check the background indexing status using the
[Health](/dgraph/self-managed/dgraph-alpha#querying-health) query on the
`/admin` endpoint.

An alter operation fails if one is already in progress with an error
`schema is already being modified. Please retry`.

Dgraph reports the indexes in the schema only when the indexes are done
computing.

## Deleting a node type

Type definitions can be deleted using the Alter endpoint.

Below is an example deleting the type `Person` using the Go client:

```go
err := c.Alter(context.Background(), &api.Operation{
                DropOp: api.Operation_TYPE,
                DropValue: "Person"})
```
