Dgraph logs requests for queries and mutations, and also provides audit logging
capabilities with a Dgraph [enterprise license](/enterprise-features/license).

Dgraph's log format comes from the glog library and is
[formatted](https://github.com/golang/glog/blob/23def4e6c14b4da8ac2ed8007337bc5eb5007998/glog.go#L523-L533)
as follows:

```sh
Lmmdd hh:mm:ss.uuuuuu threadid file:line] msg...
```

The fields are defined as follows:

| Field             | Definition                                                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `L`               | A single character, representing the log level (such as 'I' for INFO) |
| `mm`              | Month (zero padded; ie May is '05')                                   |
| `dd`              | Day (zero padded)                                                     |
| `hh:mm:ss.uuuuuu` | Time in hours, minutes and fractional seconds                         |
| `threadid`        | Space-padded thread ID as returned by GetTID()                        |
| `file`            | Filename                                                              |
| `line`            | Line number                                                           |
| `msg`             | User-supplied message                                                 |

## Log verbosity

To increase log verbosity, set the flag `-v=3` (or `-v=2`) which enables verbose
logging for everything. You can set this flag on both Zero and Alpha nodes.

<Note>Changing log verbosity requires a restart of the node.</Note>

## Request logging

Request logging, sometimes called _query logging_, lets you log queries and
mutations. You can dynamically turn request logging on or off. To toggle request
logging on, send the following GraphQL mutation to the `/admin` endpoint of an
Alpha node (for example `localhost:8080/admin`):

```graphql
mutation {
  config(input: { logDQLRequest: true }) {
    response {
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>This input flag was named `logRequest` in versions prior to v23.</Note>

The response should look like the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "config": {
      "response": {
        "code": "Success",
        "message": "Config updated successfully"
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    "tracing": {
      "version": 1,
      "startTime": "2020-12-07T14:53:28.240420495Z",
      "endTime": "2020-12-07T14:53:28.240569604Z",
      "duration": 149114
    }
  }
}
```

The Alpha node prints the following `INFO` message to confirm that the mutation
has been applied:

```sh
I1207 14:53:28.240516   20143 config.go:39] Got config update through GraphQL admin API
```

When enabling request logging this prints the requests that Dgraph Alpha
receives from Ratel or other clients. In this case, the Alpha log prints
something similar to:

```sh
I1201 13:06:26.686466   10905 server.go:908] Got a query: query:"{\n  query(func: allofterms(name@en, \"Marc Caro\"))
{\n  uid\n  name@en\n  director.film\n  }\n}"
```

As you can see, we got the query that Alpha received. To read it in the original
DQL format just replace every `\n` with a new line, any `\t` with a tab
character and `\"` with `"`:

```graphql
{
  query(func: allofterms(name@en, "Marc Caro")) {
  uid
  name@en
  director.film
  }
}
```

Similarly, you can turn off request logging by setting `logRequest` to `false`
in the `/admin` mutation.

```graphql
mutation {
  config(input: { logRequest: false }) {
    response {
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Audit logging (enterprise feature)

With a Dgraph enterprise license, you can enable audit logging so that all
requests are tracked and available for use in security audits. To learn more,
see [Audit Logging](./enterprise-features/audit-logs).
