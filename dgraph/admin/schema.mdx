title: Retrieve Schema
---

You can retrieve the Dgraph schema containing the list of predicates types and
node types by:

- issuing a query on /query endpoint using the
  [HTTP Client](/raw-http#query-current-dql-schema)
- issuing a query using any [DQL client library](./dql/clients)
- using [Ratel UI](./ratel/schema)
- using the Cloud console through the
  [DQL Schema](https://cloud.dgraph.io/_/schema?tab=dqlschema) tab of the Schema
  section.

When using a query, the request body is

```
schema {}
```

<Note>
  Unlike regular queries, the schema query is not surrounded by curly braces.
  Also, schema queries and regular queries cannot be combined.
</Note>

You can query for particular schema fields in the query body.

```
schema {
  type
  index
  reverse
  tokenizer
  list
  count
  upsert
  lang
}
```

You can also query for particular predicates:

```
schema(pred: [name, friend]) {
  type
  index
  reverse
  tokenizer
  list
  count
  upsert
  lang
}
```

<Note>
  If ACL is enabled, then the schema query returns only the predicates for which
  the logged-in ACL user has read access.
</Note>

Types can also be queried. Below are some example queries.

```
schema(type: Movie) {}
schema(type: [Person, Animal]) {}
```

Note that type queries do not contain anything between the curly braces. The
output will be the entire definition of the requested types.
