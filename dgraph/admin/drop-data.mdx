It is possible to drop all data from your Dgraph backend, and start fresh while
retaining the same endpoint.

Be careful, as this operation isn't reversible, and all data is lost. It is
highly recommended that you [export](./export) your data before you drop your
data.

### Dropping data programmatically

You can drop data by invoking the `dropData` mutation on `/admin/slash`
endpoint.

As an example, if your GraphQL endpoint is `https://<your-backend>/graphql`,
then the admin endpoint for schema is at `https://<your-backend>/admin/slash`.

This endpoint requires authentication.

Here is curl example.

```sh
curl 'https://<your-backend>/admin/slash' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' \
  --data-binary 'mutation { dropData(allData: true) { response { code message } } }'
```

If you would like to drop the schema along with the data, then you can set the
`allDataAndSchema` flag.

```sh
curl 'https://<your-backend>/admin/slash' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' \
  --data-binary 'mutation { dropData(allDataAndSchema: true) { response { code message } } }'
```

## Self-managed

### Drop data and schema

The `/alter` endpoint is used to drop data.

To drop all data and schema:

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8080/alter -d '{"drop_all": true}'
```

To drop all data only (keep schema):

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8080/alter -d '{"drop_op": "DATA"}'
```

The `/alter` endpoint can also be used to drop a specific property or all nodes
of a specific type.

To drop property `name`:

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8080/alter -d '{"drop_attr": "name"}'
```

To drop the type `Film`:

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8080/alter -d '{"drop_op": "TYPE", "drop_value": "Film"}'
```
