<DgraphWIP />

As an `Administrator` you can initialize a new Dgraph cluster by doing an
[Initial import](/dgraph/admin/bulk-loader) and you can import data into a
running instance by performing a [Live import](/dgraph/admin/live-loader).

Initial import is **considerably faster** than the live import but can only be
used to load data into a new cluster (without prior data) and is executed before
starting the Alpha nodes.

<Tip>
  Contact us if you need to do an initial import to a Dgraph backend on
  Hypermode.

<Note>
  Both options accept [RDF N-Quad/Triple data](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/)
  or JSON format.
</Note>

To load CSV-formatted data or SQL data into Dgraph, first convert the dataset
into one of the accepted formats
([RDF N-Quad/Triple](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/) or JSON) and then load the
resulting dataset into Dgraph.

After you convert the `.csv` or `.sql` files to
[RDF N-Quad/Triple](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/) or JSON, you can use
[Dgraph Live Loader](/dgraph/admin/live-loader) or
[Dgraph Bulk Loader](/dgraph/admin/bulk-loader) to import your data.
