title: Language Support
---

<Note>
  A `@lang` directive must be specified in the schema to query or mutate
  predicates with language tags.
</Note>

Dgraph supports UTF-8 strings.

In a query, for a string valued edge `edge`, the syntax

```dql
edge@lang1:...:langN
```

specifies the preference order for returned languages, with the following rules.

- At most one result is returned (except in the case where the language list is
  set to \*).
- The preference list is considered left to right: if a value in given language
  isn't found, the next language from the list is considered.
- If there are no values in any of the specified languages, no value is
  returned.
- A final `.` means that a value without a specified language is returned or if
  there is no value without language, a value in ''some'' language is returned.
- Setting the language list value to \* returns all the values for that
  predicate along with their language. Values without a language tag are also
  returned.

For example:

- `name` => Look for an untagged string; return nothing if no untagged value
  exits.
- `name@.` => Look for an untagged string, then any language.
- `name@en` => Look for `en` tagged string; return nothing if no `en` tagged
  string exists.
- `name@en:.` => Look for `en`, then untagged, then any language.
- `name@en:pl` => Look for `en`, then `pl`, otherwise nothing.
- `name@en:pl:.` => Look for `en`, then `pl`, then untagged, then any language.
- `name@*` => Look for all the values of this predicate and return them along
  with their language. For example, if there are two values with languages en
  and hi, this query returns two keys named "name@en" and "name@hi".

<Note>

In functions, language lists (including the `@*` notation) aren't allowed.
Untagged predicates, Single language tags, and `.` notation work as described
above.

In [full-text search functions](./query-language/functions.md#full-text-search)
(`alloftext`, `anyoftext`), when no language is specified (untagged or `@.`),
the default (English) full-text tokenizer is used. This does not mean that the
value with the `en` tag will be searched when querying the untagged value, but
that untagged values will be treated as English text. If you don't want that to
be the case, use the appropriate tag for the desired language, both for mutating
and querying the value.

</Note>

Query Example: some of Bollywood director and actor Farhan Akhtar's movies have
a name stored in Russian as well as Hindi and English, others do not.

```json
query {
  q(func: allofterms(name@en, "Farhan Akhtar")) {
    name@hi
    name@en

    director.film {
      name@ru:hi:en
      name@en
      name@hi
      name@ru
    }
  }
}
```
