title: Query
---

Fetching data with Dgraph Query Language (DQL), is done through **DQL Queries**.
Adding, modifying or deleting data is done through
[DQL Mutations](./dql-mutation).

This overview explains the structure of DQL Queries and provides links to the
appropriate DQL reference documentation.

### DQL query structure

DQL is **declarative**, which means that queries return a response back in a
similar shape to the query. It gives the client app the control of what it gets:
the request return exactly what you ask for, nothing less and nothing more. In
this, DQL is similar to GraphQL from which it's inspired.

A DQL query finds nodes based on search criteria, matches patterns in the graph
and returns the node attributes, relationships specified in the query.

A DQL query has

- an optional parameterization, ie a name and a list of parameters
- an opening curly bracket
- at least one [query block](./#query-block), but can contain many blocks
- optional var blocks
- a closing curly bracket

### Query parameterization

**Parameters**

- must have a name starting with a `$` symbol.
- must have a type `int`, `float`, `bool` or `string`.
- may have a default value. In the example below, `$age` has a default value of
  `95`
- may be mandatory by suffixing the type with a `!`. Mandatory parameters can't
  have a default value.

Variables can be used in the query where a string, float, int or bool value are
needed.

You can also use a variable holding `uids` by using a string variable and by
providing the value as a quoted list in square brackets:  
`query title($uidsParam: string = "[0x1, 0x2, 0x3]") { ... }`.

**Error handling** When submitting a query using parameters, Dgraph responds
with errors if

- A parameter value is not parsable to the given type.
- The query is using a parameter that is not declared.
- A mandatory parameter is not provided

The query parameterization is optional. If you don't use parameters you can omit
it and send only the query blocks.

<Note>
  The current documentation is usually using example of queries without
  parameters.
</Note>

If you execute this query in our [Movies demo database](./graphql-fundamentals)
you can see that Dgraph will return a JSON structure similar to the request :

### Query block

A query block specifies information to retrieve from Dgraph.

A query block

- must have name
- must have a node criteria defined by the keyword `func:`
- may have ordering and pagination information
- may have a combination of filters (to apply to the root nodes)
- must provide the list of attributes and relationships to fetch for each node
  matching the root nodes.

Refer to [pagination](./pagination), [ordering](./sorting),
[connecting filters](./connecting-filters) for more information.

For each relationships to fetch, the query is using a nested block.

A nested block

- may specify filters to apply on the related nodes
- may specify criteria on the relationships attributes using
  [filtering on facets](./query-language/facets.md#filtering-on-facets))
- provides the list of relationship attributes
  ([facets](/query-language/facets))) to fetch.
- provides the list of attributes and relationships to fetch for the related
  nodes.

A nested block may contain another nested block, and such at any level.

### Escape characters in predicate names

If your predicate has special characters, wrap it with angular brackets `< >` in
the query.

E.g. `<https://myschema.org#name>  `

### Formatting options

Dgraph returns the attributes and relationships that you specified in the query.
You can specify an alternate name for the result by using [

You can flatten the response structure at any level using
[@normalize](/query-language/normalize-directive) directive.

Entering the list of all the attributes you want to fetch could be fastidious
for large queries or repeating blocks : you may take advantage of
[fragments](./query-language/fragments) and the
[expand function](./query-language/expand-predicates).

### Node criteria (used by root function or by filter)

Root criteria and filters are using [functions](./functions) applied to nodes
attributes or variables.

Dgraph offers functions for

- testing string attributes
  - term matching : [allofterms](./functions.md#allofterms),
    [anyofterms](./functions.md#anyofterms)
  - regular Expression : [regexp](./functions.md#regular-expressions)
  - fuzzy match : [match](./functions.md#fuzzy-matching)
  - full-text search : [alloftext](./functions.md#full-text-search)
- testing attribute value
  - equality : [eq](./functions.md#equal-to)
  - inequalities :
    [le,lt,ge,gt](./functions.md#less-than-less-than-or-equal-to-greater-than-and-greater-than-or-equal-to)
  - range : [between](./functions.md#between)
- testing if a node
  - has a particular predicate (an attribute or a relation) :
    [has](./functions.md#has)
  - has a given UID : [uid](./functions.md#uid)
  - has a relationship to a given node : [uid_in](./functions.md#uid_in)
  - is of a given type : type()
- testing the number of node relationships
  - equality : [eq](./functions.md#equal-to)
  - inequalities :
    [le,lt,ge,gt](./functions.md#less-than-less-than-or-equal-to-greater-than-and-greater-than-or-equal-to)
- testing geolocation attributes
  - if geo location is within distance : [near](./functions.md#near)
  - if geo location lies within a given area : [within](./functions.md#within)
  - if geo area contains a given location : [contains](./functions.md#contains)
  - if geo area intersects a given are : [intersects](./functions.md#intersects)

### Variable (`var`) block

Variable blocks (`var` blocks) start with the keyword `var` instead of a block
name.

var blocks are not reflected in the query result. They are used to compute
[query-variables](./query-variables) which are lists of node UIDs, or
[value-variables](./value-variables) which are maps from node UIDs to the
corresponding scalar values.

Note that query-variables and value-variables can also be computed in query
blocks. In that case, the query block is used to fetch and return data, and to
define some variables which must be used in other blocks of the same query.

Variables may be used as functions parameters in filters or root criteria in
other blocks.

### Summarizing functions

When dealing with array attributes or with relationships to many node, the query
may use summary functions [count](./query-language/count) ,
[min](./query-language/aggregation.md#min),
[max](./query-language/aggregation.md#max),
[avg](./query-language/aggregation.md#sum-and-avg) or
[sum](./query-language/aggregation.md#sum-and-avg).

The query may also contain
[mathematical functions](./query-language/math-on-value-variables) on value
variables.

Summary functions can be used in conjunction with
[@grouby](./query-language/groupby) directive to create aggregated value
variables.

The query may contain **anonymous block** to return computed values. **Anonymous
block** don't have a root criteria as they are not used to search for nodes but
only to returned computed values.

### Graph traversal

When you specify nested blocks and filters you basically describe a way to
traverse the graph.

[@recurse](./query-language/recurse-query) and
[@ignorereflex](./query-language/ignorereflex-directive) are directives used to
optionally configure the graph traversal.

### Pattern matching

Queries with nested blocks with filters may be turned into pattern matching
using [@cascade](./query-language/cascade-directive) directive : nodes that
donâ€™t have all attributes and all relationships specified in the query at any
sub level are not considered in the result. So only nodes "matching" the
complete query structure are returned.

### Graph algorithms

The query can ask for the shortest path between a source (from) node and
destination (to) node using the
[shortest](./query-language/kshortest-path-queries) query block.
