## Query panel

You can execute two kinds of operations: queries and mutations. The history
section holds either queries or mutations.

### Query

On this panel, you can only run DQL (former GraphQL+-). You can use `#` to
comment on something. You also have the DQL Variable. See more at
[DQL](/dgraph/dql/schema).

### Mutation

On this panel, you can run RDF and JSON mutations.

## Result panel

### Graph

On this tab you can view the query results in a Graph format. This allows you to
visualize the Nodes and their relations.

### JSON

On this tab you have the JSON response from the cluster. The actual data comes
in the `data` key. You also have the `extensions` key which returns
`server_latency`, `txn`, and other metrics.

### Request

On this tab you have the actual request sent to the cluster.

### Geo

On this tab you can visualize a query that provides Geodata.

<Note>
  Your objects must contain a predicate or alias named `location` to use the geo
  display. To show a label, use a predicate or alias named `name`.
