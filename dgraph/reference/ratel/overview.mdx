Ratel is a tool for data visualization and cluster management that's designed
from the ground-up to work with Dgraph and [DQL](.//query-language). You can use
it for the following types of tasks:

- Connect to a backend and manage cluster settings (see
  [Connection](.//ratel/connection))
- Run DQL queries and mutations, and see results (see
  [Console](.//ratel/console))
- Update or replace your DQL schema, and drop data (see
  [Schema](.//ratel/schema))
- Get information on cluster nodes and remove nodes (see
  [Cluster](.//ratel/cluster))
- Backup your server if you are using self-managed Dgraph (see
  [Backup](.//ratel/backups))

To get started with Ratel, use it online with the
[Dgraph Ratel Dashboard](https://play.dgraph.io) or clone and build Ratel using
the
[instructions from the Ratel repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ratel/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
