title: Count
---

Syntax Examples:

- `count(predicate)`
- `count(uid)`

The form `count(predicate)` counts how many `predicate` edges lead out of a
node.

The form `count(uid)` counts the number of UIDs matched in the enclosing block.

Query Example: the number of films acted in by each actor with `Orlando` in
their name.

````json { me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Orlando"))
@filter(has(actor.film)) { name@en count(actor.film) } } ```

Count can be used at root and [aliased](./query-language/alias).

Query Example: count of directors who have directed more than five films. When
used at the query root, the [count index](./dql-schema.md#count-index) is
required.

```json { directors(func: gt(count(director.film), 5)) { totalDirectors
: count(uid) } } ```

Count can be assigned to a
[value variable](./query-language/value-variables.md).

Query Example: the actors of Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman" ordered by the
number of movies acted in.

```json { var(func: allofterms(name@en, "eat drink man woman")) {
starring { actors as performance.actor { totalRoles as count(actor.film) } } }

edmw(func: uid(actors), orderdesc: val(totalRoles)) { name@en name@zh totalRoles
: val(totalRoles) } } ```
