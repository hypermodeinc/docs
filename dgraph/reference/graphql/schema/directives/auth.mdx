title: "@auth"
---

`@auth` allows you to define how to apply authorization rules on the
queries/mutation for a type.

Refer to [graphql endpoint security](./graphql/security/_index.md),
[RBAC rules](./RBAC-rules.md) and
[Graph traversal rules](./graphtraversal-rules.md) for details.

`@auth` directive is not supported on `union` and `@remote` types.
