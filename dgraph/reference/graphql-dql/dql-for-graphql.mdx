title: Use DQL in GraphQL
---

Dgraph Query Language ([DQL](./dql)) can be used to extend GraphQL API
capabilities when writing:

- [custom DQL resolvers](./custom-dql)
- [subscriptions on DQL queries](./subscriptions#subscriptions-to-custom-dql)

When writing custom DQL query resolvers, you must understand the
[GraphQL - DQL schema mapping](./graphql-dql-schema) to use proper aliases
inside DQL queries to map them to the GraphQL response.
