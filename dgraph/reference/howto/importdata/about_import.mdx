title: Import data
---

As an `Administrator` you can initialize a new Dgraph cluster by doing an
[Initial import](./bulk-loader) and you can import data into a running instance
by performing a [Live import](./live-loader).

Initial import is **considerably faster** than the live import but can only be
used to load data into a new cluster (without prior data) and is executed before
starting the Alpha nodes.

<Note>
  Contact us if you need to do an initial import on a Dgraph Cloud instance.

<Note>
  Both options accept [RDF N-Quad/Triple data](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/)
  or JSON format. Refers to [data migration](./about-data-migration) to see how
  to convert other data formats.
