The list of all directives supported by Dgraph.

### @auth

`@auth` allows you to define how to apply authorization rules on the
queries/mutation for a type.

Reference: [Auth directive](./auth)

### @cascade

`@cascade` allows you to filter out certain nodes within a query.

Reference: [Cascade](/graphql/queries/cascade)

### @custom

`@custom` directive is used to define custom queries, mutations and fields.

Reference: [Custom directive](./graphql/custom/directive)

### @deprecated

The `@deprecated` directive lets you mark the schema definition of a field or
`enum` value as deprecated, and also lets you provide an optional reason for the
deprecation.

Reference: [Deprecation](./deprecated)

### @dgraph

`@dgraph` directive tells us how to map fields within a type to existing
predicates inside Dgraph.

Reference: [@dgraph directive](./directive-dgraph)

### @embedding

`@embedding` directive designates one or more fields as vector embeddings.

Reference: [@embedding directive](./embedding)

### @generate

The `@generate` directive is used to specify which GraphQL APIs are generated
for a type.

Reference: [Generate directive](./generate)

### @hasInverse

`@hasInverse` is used to setup up two way edges such that adding a edge in one
direction automatically adds the one in the inverse direction.

Reference: [Linking nodes in the graph](./graph-links)

### @id

`@id` directive is used to annotate a field which represents a unique identifier
coming from outside of Dgraph.

Reference: [Identity]((./ids)

### @include

The `@include` directive can be used to include a field based on the value of an
`if` argument.

Reference: [Include directive](./skip-include)

### @lambda

The `@lambda` directive allows you to call custom JavaScript resolvers. The
`@lambda` queries, mutations, and fields are resolved through the lambda
functions implemented on a given lambda server.

Reference: [Lambda directive](./lambda-overview)

### @remote

`@remote` directive is used to annotate types for which data is not stored in
Dgraph. These types are typically used with custom queries and mutations.

Reference: [Remote directive](./directive.md#remote-types)

### @remoteResponse

The `@remoteResponse` directive allows you to annotate the fields of a `@remote`
type in order to map a custom query's JSON key response to a GraphQL field.

Reference: [Remote directive](./directive.md##remote-response)

### @search

`@search` allows you to perform filtering on a field while querying for nodes.

Reference: [Search](./search)

### @secret

`@secret` directive is used to store secret information, it gets encrypted and
then stored in Dgraph.

Reference: [Password Type](./types.md#password-type)

### @skip

The `@skip` directive can be used to fetch a field based on the value of a
user-defined GraphQL variable.

Reference: [Skip directive](./skip-include)

### @withSubscription

`@withSubscription` directive when applied on a type, generates subscription
queries for it.

Reference: [Subscriptions](./subscriptions)

### @lambdaOnMutate

The `@lambdaOnMutate` directive allows you to listen to mutation
events(`add`/`update`/`delete`). Depending on the defined events and the
occurrence of a mutation event, `@lambdaOnMutate` triggers the appropriate
lambda function implemented on a given lambda server.

Reference: [LambdaOnMutate directive](./webhook)
