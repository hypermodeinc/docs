The `@withSubscription` directive enables **subscription** operation on a
GraphQL type.

A subscription notifies your client with changes to back-end data using the
WebSocket protocol. Subscriptions are useful to get low-latency, real-time
updates.

To enable subscriptions on any type add the `@withSubscription` directive to the
schema as part of the type definition, as in the following example:

```graphql
type Todo @withSubscription {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String!
  completed: Boolean!
}
```

Refer to [GraphQL Subscriptions](/dgraph/graphql/subscriptions) to learn how to
use subscriptions in you client app.
