A Float array can be used as a vector using `@embedding` directive. It denotes a
vector of floating point numbers, i.e an ordered array of float32.

The embeddings can be defined on one or more predicates of a type and they're
generated using suitable machine learning models.

This directive is used in conjunction with `@search` directive to declare the
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index. For more information see:
[@search](/dgraph/graphql/schema/directives/search#vector-embedding) directive
for vector embeddings.
