<DgraphWIP />

Dgraph supports Persistent Queries. When a client uses persistent queries, the
client only sends the hash of a query to the server. The server has a list of
known hashes and uses the associated query accordingly.

Persistent queries significantly improve the performance and the security of an
app since the smaller hash signature reduces bandwidth utilization and speeds up
client loading times.

### Persisted query logic

The execution of Persistent Queries follows this logic:

- If the `extensions` key isn't provided in the `GET` request, Dgraph processes
  the request as usual
- If a `persistedQuery` exists under the `extensions` key, Dgraph tries to
  process a Persisted Query:
  - if no `sha256` hash is provided, process the query without persisting
  - if the `sha256` hash is provided, try to retrieve the persisted query

Example:

```json
{
  "persistedQuery": {
    "sha256Hash": "b952c19b894e1aa89dc05b7d53e15ab34ee0b3a3f11cdf3486acef4f0fe85c52"
  }
}
```

### Create

To create a Persistent Query, both `query` and `sha256` must be provided.

Dgraph verifies the hash and performs a lookup. If the query doesn't exist,
Dgraph stores the query, provided that the `sha256` of the query is correct.
Finally, Dgraph processes the query and returns the results.

Example:

```sh
curl -g 'http://localhost:8080/graphql/?query={sample_query}&extensions={"persistedQuery":{"sha256Hash":"b952c19b894e1aa89dc05b7d53e15ab34ee0b3a3f11cdf3486acef4f0fe85c52"}}'
```

### Lookup

If only a `sha256` is provided, Dgraph does a look-up, and processes the query
if found. Otherwise a `PersistedQueryNotFound` error is returned.

Example: curl -g
'http://localhost:8080/graphql/?extensions={"persistedQuery":{"sha256Hash":"b952c19b894e1aa89dc05b7d53e15ab34ee0b3a3f11cdf3486acef4f0fe85c52"}}'

### Usage with Apollo

You can create an [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) client with
persisted queries enabled. In the background, Apollo sends the same requests
like the ones previously shown.

For example:

```go
import { createPersistedQueryLink } from "apollo-link-persisted-queries";
import { createHttpLink } from "apollo-link-http";
import { InMemoryCache } from "apollo-cache-inmemory";
import ApolloClient from "apollo-client";
const link = createPersistedQueryLink().concat(createHttpLink({ uri: "/graphql" }));
const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: link,
});
```
