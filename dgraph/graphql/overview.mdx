Dgraph lets you generate a GraphQL API and a graph backend from a single
[GraphQL schema](/dgraph/graphql/schema/overview), no resolvers or custom
queries are needed. Dgraph automatically generates the GraphQL operations for
[queries](/dgraph/graphql/query/overview) and
[mutations](/dgraph/graphql/mutation/overview)

GraphQL developers can [get started](./quickstart) in minutes, and need not
concern themselves with the powerful graph database running in the background.

Dgraph extends the [GraphQL specifications](https://spec.graphql.org/) with
[directives](/dgraph/graphql/schema/directives/overview) and allows you to
customize the behavior of GraphQL operations using
[custom resolvers](/dgraph/graphql/schema/directives/custom) or to write you own
resolver logic with [Lambda resolvers](/dgraph/graphql/lambda/overview).

Dgraph also supports

- [GraphQL subscriptions](./subscriptions) with the `@withSubscription`
  directive: a client app can execute a subscription query and receive real-time
  updates when the subscription query result is updated.
- [Apollo federation](/dgraph/graphql/schema/federation) : you can create a
  gateway GraphQL service that includes the Dgraph GraphQL API and other GraphQL
  services.
