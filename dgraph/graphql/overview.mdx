  Generate a GraphQL API and a graph backend from a single GraphQL schema.

Dgraph lets you generate a GraphQL API and a graph backend from a single
[GraphQL schema](./schema/_index.md), no resolvers or custom queries are needed.
Dgraph automatically generates the GraphQL operations for
[queries](./queries/_index.md) and [mutations](/mutations/_index.md)

GraphQL developers can [get started](./quick-start/index.md) in minutes, and
need not concern themselves with the powerful graph database running in the
background.

Dgraph extends the [GraphQL specifications](https://spec.graphql.org/) with
[directives](./schema/directives/_index.md) and allows you to customize the
behavior of GraphQL operations using [custom resolvers](./custom-overview.md) or
to write you own resolver logic with [Lambda resolvers](./lambda-overview.md).

Dgraph also supports

- [GraphQL subscriptions](./subscriptions/index.md) with the `@withSubscription`
  directive: a client app can execute a subscription query and receive real-time
  updates when the subscription query result is updated.
- [Apollo federation](./federation/index) : you can create a gateway GraphQL
  service that includes the Dgraph GraphQL API and other GraphQL services.
