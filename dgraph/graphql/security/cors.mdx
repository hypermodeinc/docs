title: Restrict origins

To restrict origins of HTTP requests:

1. Add lines starting with `# Dgraph.Allow-Origin` at the end of your GraphQL
   schema specifying the origins allowed.
2. Deploy the GraphQL schema either with a
   [schema update](/dgraph/graphql/api#using-updategqlschema-to-add-or-modify-a-schema)
   or via the Cloud console's [Schema](https://cloud.dgraph.io/_/schema) page.

For example, the following restricts all origins except the ones specified.

```sh
# Dgraph.Allow-Origin "https://example.com"
# Dgraph.Allow-Origin "https://www.example.com"
```

`https://cloud.dgraph.io` is always allowed so that `API explorer`, in Dgraph
Cloud console, continues to work.

<Note>CORS restrictions only apply to browsers.</Note>

<Note>
  By default, the `/graphql` endpoint doesn't limit the request origin
  (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`).
</Note>
