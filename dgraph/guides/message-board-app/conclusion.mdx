Congratulations on finishing the Dgraph Learn course: **Build a Message Board
App in React**!

You’ve now learned how to add much of the core functionality to your React app.
In the advanced course (coming soon), you’ll add login and authorization,
subscriptions, and custom logic to this app.

Playing with your app and taking your code to the next level? Be sure to share
your creations on our [discussion boards](https://discuss.dgraph.io). We love to
see what you’re working on, and feel free to ask any questions - our team of
developers typically respond within 30 minutes!

We hope you’ve enjoyed playing with [Dgraph Cloud](https://dgraph.io/cloud) for
this course. A fully managed GraphQL backend database service, Dgraph Cloud lets
you focus on building apps, not managing infrastructure.

Want to learn more? Check out [another guide](/dgraph/guides), or explore the
[docs](/dgraph/overview).

And if you have been reading along but haven't tried it yet,
[try Dgraph Cloud](https://cloud.dgraph.io/) to launch your first hosted GraphQL
database.
