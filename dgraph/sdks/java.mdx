<DgraphWIP />

A minimal implementation for a Dgraph client for Java 1.11+, using
[gRPC](https://grpc.io/). This client follows the [Dgraph Go client](./go)
closely.

<Tip>
  The official Java client [can be found
  here](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph4j). Follow the [install
  instructions](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph4j#download) to get it up
  and running.
</Tip>

## Supported versions

More details on the supported versions can be found at
[this link](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph4j#supported-versions).

## Quickstart

Build and run the
[DgraphJavaSample](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph4j/tree/main/samples/DgraphJavaSample)
project in the `samples` folder, which contains an end-to-end example of using
the Dgraph Java client. Follow the instructions in the
[README](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph4j/tree/main/samples/DgraphJavaSample/README.md)
of that project.

## Intro

This library supports two styles of clients, the synchronous client
`DgraphClient` and the async client `DgraphAsyncClient`. A `DgraphClient` or
`DgraphAsyncClient` can be initialized by passing it a list of
`DgraphBlockingStub` clients. The `anyClient()` API can randomly pick a stub,
which can then be used for gRPC operations.

## Using the synchronous client

<Tip>
  You can find a
  [DgraphJavaSample](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph4j/tree/main/samples/DgraphJavaSample)
  project, which contains an end-to-end working example of how to use the Java
  client.
</Tip>

### Creating a client

The following code snippet shows how to create a synchronous client using three
connections.

```java
ManagedChannel channel1 = ManagedChannelBuilder
    .forAddress("localhost", 9080)
    .usePlaintext().build();
DgraphStub stub1 = DgraphGrpc.newStub(channel1);

ManagedChannel channel2 = ManagedChannelBuilder
    .forAddress("localhost", 9082)
    .usePlaintext().build();
DgraphStub stub2 = DgraphGrpc.newStub(channel2);

ManagedChannel channel3 = ManagedChannelBuilder
    .forAddress("localhost", 9083)
    .usePlaintext().build();
DgraphStub stub3 = DgraphGrpc.newStub(channel3);

DgraphClient dgraphClient = new DgraphClient(stub1, stub2, stub3);
```

### Login using access control lists

If [Access Control Lists (ACL)](/dgraph/enterprise/access-control-lists) is
enabled then you can log-in to the default namespace (`0`) with the following
method:

```java
dgraphClient.login(USER_ID, USER_PASSWORD);
```

### Multi-tenancy

If [multi-tenancy](/dgraph/enterprise/multitenancy) is enabled, by default the
login method on client logs into the namespace `0`. In order to log into a
different namespace, use the `loginIntoNamespace` method on the client:

```java
dgraphClient.loginIntoNamespace(USER_ID, USER_PASSWORD, NAMESPACE);
```

Once logged-in, the `dgraphClient` object can be used to do any further
operations.

### Creating a secure client using TLS

To setup a client using TLS, you could use the following code snippet. The
server needs to be setup using the instructions provided
[here](/dgraph/self-managed/tls-configuration).

If you are doing client verification, you need to convert the client key from
PKCS#1 format to PKCS#8 format. By default, g doesn't support reading PKCS#1
format keys. To convert the format, you could use the `openssl` tool.

First, let's install the `openssl` tool:

```sh
apt install openssl
```

Now, use the following command to convert the key:

```sh
openssl pkcs8 -in client.name.key -topk8 -nocrypt -out client.name.java.key
```

Now, you can use the following code snippet to connect to Alpha over TLS:

```java
SslContextBuilder builder = GrpcSslContexts.forClient();
builder.trustManager(new File("<path to ca.crt>"));
// Skip the next line if you are not performing client verification.
builder.keyManager(new File("<path to client.name.crt>"), new File("<path to client.name.java.key>"));
SslContext sslContext = builder.build();

ManagedChannel channel = NettyChannelBuilder.forAddress("localhost", 9080)
    .sslContext(sslContext)
    .build();
DgraphGrpc.DgraphStub stub = DgraphGrpc.newStub(channel);
DgraphClient dgraphClient = new DgraphClient(stub);
```

### Check Dgraph version

Checking the version of the Dgraph server this client is interacting with is as
easy as:

```java
Version v = dgraphClient.checkVersion();
System.out.println(v.getTag());
```

Checking the version, before doing anything else can be used as a test to find
out if the client is able to communicate with the Dgraph server. This also helps
reduce the latency of the first query/mutation which results from some dynamic
library loading and linking that happens in JVM (see
[this issue](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph4j/issues/108) for more
details).

### Altering the database

To set the schema, create an `Operation` object, set the schema and pass it to
`DgraphClient#alter` method.

```java
String schema = "name: string @index(exact) .";
Operation operation = Operation.newBuilder().setSchema(schema).build();
dgraphClient.alter(operation);
```

Starting Dgraph version 20.03.0, indexes can be computed in the background. You
can call the function `setRunInBackground(true)` as shown below before calling
`alter`. You can find more details
[here](/dgraph/admin/update-types#indexes-in-background).

```java
String schema = "name: string @index(exact) .";
Operation operation = Operation.newBuilder()
        .setSchema(schema)
        .setRunInBackground(true)
        .build();
dgraphClient.alter(operation);
```

`Operation` contains other fields as well, including drop predicate and drop
all. Drop all is useful if you wish to discard all the data, and start from a
clean slate, without bringing the instance down.

```java
// Drop all data including schema from the dgraph instance. This is useful
// for small examples such as this, since it puts dgraph into a clean
// state.
dgraphClient.alter(Operation.newBuilder().setDropAll(true).build());
```

### Creating a transaction

There are two types of transactions in dgraph, queries (reads) and mutations
(writes). Both the synchronous `DgraphClient` and the asynchronous
`DgraphAsyncClient` clients support the two types of transactions by providing
the `newTransaction` and the `newReadOnlyTransaction` APIs. Creating a
transaction is a local operation and incurs no network overhead.

In most of the cases, the normal read-write transactions is used, which can have
any number of query or mutate operations. However, if a transaction only has
queries, you might benefit from a read-only transaction, which can share the
same read timestamp across multiple such read-only transactions and can result
in lower latencies.

For normal read-write transactions, it's a good practice to call
`Transaction#discard()` in a `finally` block after running the transaction.
Calling `Transaction#discard()` after `Transaction#commit()` is a no-op and you
can call `discard()` multiple times with no additional side-effects.

```java
Transaction txn = dgraphClient.newTransaction();
try {
    // Do something here
    // ...
} finally {
    txn.discard();
}
```

For read-only transactions, there is no need to call `Transaction.discard`,
which is equivalent to a no-op.

```java
Transaction readOnlyTxn = dgraphClient.newReadOnlyTransaction();
```

Read-only transactions can be set as best-effort. Best-effort queries relax the
requirement of linearizable reads. This is useful when running queries that do
not require a result from the latest timestamp.

```java
Transaction bestEffortTxn = dgraphClient.newReadOnlyTransaction()
    .setBestEffort(true);
```

### Running a mutation

`Transaction#mutate` runs a mutation. It takes in a `Mutation` object, which
provides two main ways to set data: JSON and RDF N-Quad. You can choose
whichever way is convenient.

We're going to use JSON. First we define a `Person` class to represent a person.
This data is serialized into JSON.

```java
class Person {
    String name
    Person() {}
}
```

Next, we initialize a `Person` object, serialize it and use it in `Mutation`
object.

```java
// Create data
Person person = new Person();
person.name = "Alice";

// Serialize it
Gson gson = new Gson();
String json = gson.toJson(person);
// Run mutation
Mutation mu = Mutation.newBuilder()
    .setSetJson(ByteString.copyFromUtf8(json.toString()))
    .build();
txn.mutate(mu);
```

Sometimes, you only want to commit mutation, without querying anything further.
In such cases, you can use a `CommitNow` field in `Mutation` object to indicate
that the mutation must be immediately committed.

Mutation can be run using the `doRequest` function as well.

```java
Request request = Request.newBuilder()
    .addMutations(mu)
    .build();
txn.doRequest(request);
```

### Committing a transaction

A transaction can be committed using the `Transaction#commit()` method. If your
transaction consisted solely of calls to `Transaction#query()`, and no calls to
`Transaction#mutate()`, then calling `Transaction#commit()` isn't necessary.

An error is returned if other transactions running concurrently modify the same
data that was modified in this transaction. It is up to the user to retry
transactions when they fail.

```java
Transaction txn = dgraphClient.newTransaction();

try {
    // …
    // Perform any number of queries and mutations
    // …
    // and finally …
    txn.commit()
} catch (TxnConflictException ex) {
    // Retry or handle exception.
} finally {
    // Clean up. Calling this after txn.commit() is a no-op
    // and hence safe.
    txn.discard();
}
```

### Running a query

You can run a query by calling `Transaction#query()`. You need to pass in a DQL
query string, and a map (optional, could be empty) of any variables that you
might want to set in the query.

The response would contain a `JSON` field, which has the JSON encoded result.
You need to decode it before you can do anything useful with it.

Let’s run the following query:

```dql
query all($a: string) {
  all(func: eq(name, $a)) {
            name
  }
}
```

First we must create a `People` class that helps us deserialize the JSON result:

```java
class People {
    List<Person> all;
    People() {}
}
```

Then we run the query, deserialize the result and print it out:

```java
// Query
String query =
"query all($a: string){\n" +
"  all(func: eq(name, $a)) {\n" +
"    name\n" +
"  }\n" +
"}\n";

Map<String, String> vars = Collections.singletonMap("$a", "Alice");
Response response = dgraphClient.newReadOnlyTransaction().queryWithVars(query, vars);

// Deserialize
People ppl = gson.fromJson(response.getJson().toStringUtf8(), People.class);

// Print results
System.out.printf("people found: %d\n", ppl.all.size());
ppl.all.forEach(person -> System.out.println(person.name));
```

This should print:

```sh
people found: 1
Alice
```

You can also use `doRequest` function to run the query.

```java
Request request = Request.newBuilder()
    .setQuery(query)
    .build();
txn.doRequest(request);
```

### Running a Query with RDF response

You can get query results as an RDF response by calling either `queryRDF()` or
`queryRDFWithVars()`. The response contains the `getRdf()` method, which
provides the RDF encoded output.

<Note>
  If you are querying for `uid` values only, use a JSON format response.
</Note>

```java
// Query
String query = "query me($a: string) { me(func: eq(name, $a)) { name }}";
Map<String, String> vars = Collections.singletonMap("$a", "Alice");
Response response =
    dgraphAsyncClient.newReadOnlyTransaction().queryRDFWithVars(query, vars).join();

// Print results
System.out.println(response.getRdf().toStringUtf8());
```

This should print (assuming Alice's `uid` is `0x2`):

```sh
<0x2> <name> "Alice" .
```

### Running an upsert: query + mutation

The `txn.doRequest` function allows you to run upserts consisting of one query
and one mutation. Variables can be defined in the query and used in the
mutation. You could also use `txn.doRequest` to perform a query followed by a
mutation.

```java
String query = "query {\n" +
  "user as var(func: eq(email, \"wrong_email@dgraph.io\"))\n" +
  "}\n";
Mutation mu = Mutation.newBuilder()
    .setSetNquads(ByteString.copyFromUtf8("uid(user) <email> \"correct_email@dgraph.io\" ."))
    .build();
Request request = Request.newBuilder()
    .setQuery(query)
    .addMutations(mu)
    .setCommitNow(true)
    .build();
txn.doRequest(request);
```

### Running a conditional upsert

The upsert block also allows specifying a conditional mutation block using an
`@if` directive. The mutation is executed only when the specified condition is
true. If the condition is false, the mutation is silently ignored.

See more about Conditional Upsert
[Here](/dgraph/dql/mutation#conditional-upsert).

```java
String query = "query {\n" +
    "user as var(func: eq(email, \"wrong_email@dgraph.io\"))\n" +
    "}\n";
Mutation mu = Mutation.newBuilder()
    .setSetNquads(ByteString.copyFromUtf8("uid(user) <email> \"correct_email@dgraph.io\" ."))
    .setCond("@if(eq(len(user), 1))")
    .build();
Request request = Request.newBuilder()
    .setQuery(query)
    .addMutations(mu)
    .setCommitNow(true)
    .build();
txn.doRequest(request);
```

### Setting deadlines

It is recommended that you always set a deadline for each client call, after
which the client terminates. This is in line with the recommendation for any
gRPC client. Read [this forum post][deadline-post] for more details.

```java
channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress("localhost", 9080).usePlaintext(true).build();
DgraphGrpc.DgraphStub stub = DgraphGrpc.newStub(channel);
ClientInterceptor timeoutInterceptor = new ClientInterceptor(){
    @Override
    public <ReqT, RespT> ClientCall<ReqT, RespT> interceptCall(
            MethodDescriptor<ReqT, RespT> method, CallOptions callOptions, Channel next) {
        return next.newCall(method, callOptions.withDeadlineAfter(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));
    }
};
stub.withInterceptors(timeoutInterceptor);
DgraphClient dgraphClient = new DgraphClient(stub);
```

[deadline-post]:
  https://discuss.dgraph.io/t/dgraph-java-client-setting-deadlines-per-call/3056

### Setting metadata headers

Certain headers such as authentication tokens need to be set globally for all
subsequent calls. Below is an example of setting a header with the name
"auth-token":

```java
// create the stub first
ManagedChannel channel =
ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress(TEST_HOSTNAME, TEST_PORT).usePlaintext(true).build();
DgraphStub stub = DgraphGrpc.newStub(channel);

// use MetadataUtils to augment the stub with headers
Metadata metadata = new Metadata();
metadata.put(
        Metadata.Key.of("auth-token", Metadata.ASCII_STRING_MARSHALLER), "the-auth-token-value");
stub = MetadataUtils.attachHeaders(stub, metadata);

// create the DgraphClient wrapper around the stub
DgraphClient dgraphClient = new DgraphClient(stub);

// trigger a RPC call using the DgraphClient
dgraphClient.alter(Operation.newBuilder().setDropAll(true).build());
```

### Helper methods

#### Delete multiple edges

The example below uses the helper method `Helpers#deleteEdges` to delete
multiple edges corresponding to predicates on a node with the given UID. The
helper method takes an existing mutation, and returns a new mutation with the
deletions applied.

```java
Mutation mu = Mutation.newBuilder().build()
mu = Helpers.deleteEdges(mu, uid, "friends", "loc");
dgraphClient.newTransaction().mutate(mu);
```

### Closing the database connection

To disconnect from Dgraph, call `ManagedChannel#shutdown` on the gRPC channel
object created when [creating a Dgraph client](#creating-a-client).

```java
channel.shutdown();
```

## Using the asynchronous client

Dgraph Client for Java also bundles an asynchronous API, which can be used by
instantiating the `DgraphAsyncClient` class. The usage is almost exactly the
same as the `DgraphClient` (show in previous section) class. The main
differences is that the `DgraphAsyncClient#newTransacation()` returns an
`AsyncTransaction` class. The API for `AsyncTransaction` is exactly
`Transaction`. The only difference is that instead of returning the results
directly, it returns immediately with a corresponding `CompletableFuture<T>`
object. This object represents the computation which runs asynchronously to
yield the result in the future. Read more about `CompletableFuture<T>` in the
[Java 8 documentation][futuredocs].

[futuredocs]:
  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html

Here is the asynchronous version of the preceding code, which runs a query.

```java
// Query
String query =
"query all($a: string){\n" +
"  all(func: eq(name, $a)) {\n" +
"    name\n" +
 "}\n" +
"}\n";

Map<String, String> vars = Collections.singletonMap("$a", "Alice");

AsyncTransaction txn = dgraphAsyncClient.newTransaction();
txn.query(query).thenAccept(response -> {
    // Deserialize
    People ppl = gson.fromJson(res.getJson().toStringUtf8(), People.class);

    // Print results
    System.out.printf("people found: %d\n", ppl.all.size());
    ppl.all.forEach(person -> System.out.println(person.name));
});
```

## Checking the request latency

If you would like to see the latency for either a mutation or query request, the
latency field in the returned result can be helpful. Here is an example to log
the latency of a query request:

```java
Response resp = txn.query(query);
Latency latency = resp.getLatency();
logger.info("parsing latency:" + latency.getParsingNs());
logger.info("processing latency:" + latency.getProcessingNs());
logger.info("encoding latency:" + latency.getEncodingNs());
```

Similarly you can get the latency of a mutation request:

```java
Assigned assignedIds = dgraphClient.newTransaction().mutate(mu);
Latency latency = assignedIds.getLatency();
```

## Concurrent mutations and conflicts

This how-to guide provides an example on how to handle concurrent modifications
using a multi-threaded Java Program. The example demonstrates
[transaction](./overview#transactions) conflicts in Dgraph.

Steps to run this example are as follows.

Step 1: start a new terminal and launch Dgraph with the following command line.

```sh
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 dgraph/standalone:%VERSION_HERE
```

Step 2: check out the source code from the 'samples' directory in
[dgraph4j repo](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph4j). This particular
example can found at the path `samples/concurrent-modification`. In order to run
this example, execute the following maven command from the
'concurrent-modification' folder.

```sh
mvn clean install exec:java
```

Step 3: on running the example, the program initializes Dgraph with the
following schema.

```sh
<clickCount>: int @index(int) .
<name>: string @index(exact) .
```

Step 4: the program also initializes user "Alice" with a 'clickCount' of value
'1', and then proceeds to increment 'clickCount' concurrently in two threads.
Dgraph throws an exception if a transaction is updating a given predicate that
is being concurrently modified. As part of the exception handling logic, the
program sleeps for 1 second on receiving a concurrent modification exception
(“TxnConflictException”), and then retries.

The logs below show that two threads are increasing clickCount for the same user
named Alice (note the same UID). Thread #1 succeeds immediately, and Dgraph
throws a concurrent modification conflict on Thread 2. Thread 2 sleeps for 1
second and retries, and this time succeeds.

```sh
1599628015260 Thread #2 increasing clickCount for uid 0xe, Name: Alice
1599628015260 Thread #1 increasing clickCount for uid 0xe, Name: Alice
1599628015291 Thread #1 succeeded after 0 retries
1599628015297 Thread #2 found a concurrent modification conflict, sleeping for 1 second...
1599628016297 Thread #2 resuming
1599628016310 Thread #2 increasing clickCount for uid 0xe, Name: Alice
1599628016333 Thread #2 succeeded after 1 retries
```

Step 5: please note that the final value of clickCount is 3 (initial value was
1), which is correct. Query:

```json
{
  Alice(func: has(<name>)) @filter(eq(name,"Alice" )) {
    uid
    name
    clickCount
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Alice": [
      {
        "uid": "0xe",
        "name": "Alice",
        "clickCount": 3
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Summary

Concurrent modifications to the same predicate causes the "TxnConflictException"
exception. When several transactions hit the same node's predicate at the same
time, the first one succeeds, while the other receives the
“TxnConflictException”. Upon constantly retrying, the transactions begin to
succeed one after another, and given enough retries, correctly completes its
work.
