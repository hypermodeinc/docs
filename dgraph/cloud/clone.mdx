title: Cloning Backend
---

Cloning a backend allows making a copy of an existing backend. The clone is
created with all the data and schema of the original backend present at the time
of cloning. The cloned backend has its own endpoint and is independent of the
original backend once it's created. Any further changes in either backends is
not reflected in the other. Currently, a clone can only be created in the same
zone as that of the original backend.

In order to clone your backend, click `Clone Backend` under the
[Settings](https://cloud.dgraph.io/_/settings) tab in the dashboard's sidebar.

You can also perform the restore operation on an existing backend if you have an
unused backend or want to reuse an existing endpoint. But note that the restore
operation drops all the existing data along with schema on the current backend
and replace it with the data and schema from the source backend.
