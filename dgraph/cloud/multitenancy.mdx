title: Multi-tenancy in Dgraph Cloud
---

Multi-Tenancy in Dgraph cloud is a dedicated cluster feature. It isn't supported
in free/shared clusters. Multi-tenancy is built upon Access Control Lists (ACL),
and enables multiple tenants to share a Dgraph cluster using unique namespaces.
The tenants are logically separated, and their data lies in the same p
directory. Each namespace has a group
[guardian(admin)](/dgraph/enterprise/multitenancy/#guardians-of-the-galaxy),
which has root access to that namespace.

### Enabling multi-tenancy in Dgraph Cloud

In order to enable multi-tenancy you need to do the following -

1. **Enable ACL**

   - If you are launching a dedicated cluster for the first time, you need to
     click the checkbox for ACLs under `Additional Settings`.
   - For existing dedicated cluster, you need to go to Settings > Modify Backend
     and click the checkbox for ACLs under `Additional Settings`. Note - This
     restarts your backend hence causing some downtime.

2. **Create namespaces**

   - Go to `Namespaces` page under `Admin` section on the sidebar to the left.
   - Click on `Create New` button, enter the description of the namespace and
     click `Create`.
   - You can view the created namespaces on the `Namespaces` page.
   - Please note that Tenant 0 can't be deleted.

3. **Toggle namespaces**
   - Now you should be able to see a select box next to selected backend in the
     top navigation.
   - You can switch between namespaces with the selection.
   - Also, each namespace has its own Schema, ACLs & Lambdas. Also has its own
     view of Dgraph Studio, API Explorer, DQL Page.
   - After switching namespaces, you can update view/update the namespace's
     schema and query/mutate as well.

### Accessing namespaces via client

Namespaces are protected via ACLs. You need to create a user with username &
password in the namespace. This can be done using `ACLs` page under `Admin`
section on the sidebar to the left.

In the following example, we show how to give all read access to a user for
namespace:

1. First, you should create an ACL group and select all predicates that you want
   to provision read access. ![group](/images/dgraph/cloud/acl-group.png)
2. Next, create a user with access to the created group. While creating the
   user, you are asked to provide with a username & password. Keep it handy.

3. You can go to the API Explorer and user the login mutation to fetch the API
   access token. Click on admin radio button at the top to query the admin
   endpoint. Use the mutation shown below to get the access token. (Note -
   NamespaceID can be found on the namespace page)

   ```dql
   mutation MyMutation {
       login(namespace: 1, password: "password", userId: "userID") {
           response {
               accessJWT
               refreshJWT
           }
       }
   }

   ```

4. You have the access token which you need to pass it in `X-Dgraph-AccessToken`
   header.
5. On client side you need to use this mutation to programmatically generate the
   access token for your namespace.
6. If you are using a [Dgraph client](/dgraph/sdks/overview) you need to set the
   username & password and the client handles fetching the token & refresh logic
   for you. Most of the clients have a special method to login to a specific
   namespace.
