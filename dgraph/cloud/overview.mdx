## Dgraph

Designed from day one to be distributed for scale and speed, **Dgraph** is the
native Graph database with native GraphQL support. It is open source, scalable,
distributed, highly available, and lightning fast.

Dgraph is different from other graph databases in a number of ways, including:

- **Distributed Scale**: Built from day 1 to be distributed, to handle larger
  data sets.

- **GraphQL Support**: GraphQL is built in to make data access simple and
  standards-compliant. Unlike most GraphQL solutions, no resolvers are needed -
  Dgraph resolves queries automatically through graph navigation.

- **Fully Transactional and ACID Compliant**: Dgraph satisfies demanding OLTP
  workloads that require frequent inserts and updates.

- **Language support & Text Search**: Full-text searching is included and
  strings can be expressed in multiple languages

- **Gelocation data and geo queries**: Dgraph can store Points and Shapes and
  queries can use near, within, contains, intersects geo functions

## Dgraph Cloud

Dgraph Cloud gives you the power of Dgraph database including performance,
high-availability, horizontally scalability and the support of GraphQL for rapid
app development in a hosted and fully managed environment. Dgraph Cloud lets you
focus on building apps, not managing infrastructure.

### Cloud cluster types

- **Shared Instance**: Dgraph Cloud with
  [shared instances](https://cloud.dgraph.io/pricing?type=shared) is a fast and
  easy way to get started with GraphQL, and doesn't require any graph database
  knowledge to start and run. Shared instances run in a common database using
  Dgraph multi-tenancy. Your data is protected but you share resources and have
  limited scale.

- **Dedicated instances** run on their own dedicated hardware to ensure
  consistent performance. This option extends the capabilities of the lower-cost
  shared instances to support enterprise, production workloads, and includes a
  high availability option.

| Production-ready                                          | Dgraph Cloud is built to meet the needs of your business as it grows with built-in authorization, encryption at rest, TLS, incremental backups, and more.                                                                                                |
| Scale and expand your app without rebuilding your backend | Dgraph Cloud stores and distributes data to optimize the execution of GraphQL traversals, joins, and retrievals. Dgraph natively parses and executes GraphQL, achieving great performance and the ability to scale horizontally up to terabytes of data. |
| A high-performance, graph-first database                  | Dgraph Cloud runs Dgraph database, which is built to support the needs of modern apps with lightning-fast queries at any depth.                                                                                                                          |
| Custom logic                                              | Use JavaScript to add programmatic custom logic on the backend, adding power to your apps without sacrificing client-side performance.                                                                                                                   |
| Power your app with native GraphQL support                | Dgraph is built for graph data, so you don’t need to configure and maintain a cumbersome GraphQL layer over a traditional relational database.                                                                                                           |
| Evolve your schema without downtime                       | When it comes time to deploy a new schema, you can do that in seconds, not hours.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| GraphQL-based authorization and management                | GraphQL is used throughout Dgraph Cloud, so you don’t need to use another tool or learn another syntax to handle user authorization or database administration tasks such as schema changes and data exports.                                            |
| Work with the Open Source ecosystem                       | Because Dgraph is open source, your app relies on a codebase that you can contribute to, not an opaque “black box”.                                                                                                                                      |
