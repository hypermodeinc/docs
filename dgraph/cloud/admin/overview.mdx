Here is a guide to programmatically administering your Dgraph Cloud backend.

Wherever possible, we have maintained compatibility with the corresponding
Dgraph API, with the additional step of requiring
[authentication](./authentication) via the `X-Auth-Token` header.

<Note>
  Keep in mind that free Dgraph Cloud backends will be frozen automatically
  after 4 hours of inactivity.
</Note>

Please see the following topics:

- [Authentication](./authentication) will guide you in creating a API token.
  Since all admin APIs require an auth token, this is a good place to start.
- [Schema](./schema) describes how to programmatically query and update your
  GraphQL schema.
- [Import and Exporting Data](./import-export) is a guide for exporting your
  data from a Dgraph Cloud backend, and how to import it into another cluster
- [Dropping Data](./drop-data) will guide you through dropping all data from
  your Dgraph Cloud backend.
