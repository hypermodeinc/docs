title: Fetching and Updating Your Schema
---

<DgraphWIP />

Your GraphQL schema can be fetched and updated using the `/admin` endpoint of
your cluster. As an example, if your GraphQL endpoint is
`https://frozen-mango.us-west-2.aws.cloud.dgraph.io/graphql`, then the admin
endpoint for schema is at
`https://frozen-mango.us-west-2.aws.cloud.dgraph.io/admin`.

This endpoint works in a similar way to the [/admin](/dgraph/graphql/api#admin)
endpoint of Dgraph, with the additional constraint of
[requiring authentication](./authentication).

### Fetching the current schema

It is possible to fetch your current schema using the `getGQLSchema` query on
`/admin`. Below is a sample GraphQL query which fetches this schema.

```graphql
{
  getGQLSchema {
    schema
  }
}
```

### Setting a new schema

You can save a new schema using the `updateGQLSchema` mutation on `/admin`.
Below is an example GraphQL body, with a variable called `sch` which must be
passed in as a [variable](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/)

```graphql
mutation ($sch: String!) {
  updateGQLSchema(input: { set: { schema: $sch } }) {
    gqlSchema {
      schema
      generatedSchema
    }
  }
}
```
