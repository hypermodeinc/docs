<DgraphWIP />

Dgraph Cloud provides enterprises with real-time observability and high-fidelity
telemetry of their instances with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). Once
enabled Dgraph exposes real-time values for **Dedicated** backends at any given
instant via the `/prometheus` endpoint. You can also configure Grafana for
real-time visualization and analysis thus allowing for in-depth visibility into
the behavior, performance and health of your instances.

<Note>
  Prometheus integration is only available to users of **Dedicated Instance**
  types and not **Free** or **Shared Instance**.
</Note>

### Enable Prometheus for your instance

To enable Prometheus with your Dgraph Cloud instance:

1. Login to Dgraph Cloud Dashboard, select **Settings** under the **Admin**
   subsection and then select **Modify Backend**. Alternately, you can also
   enable Prometheus while launching a new backend.

2. For your existing **Dgraph Cloud Backend**, enable the **Prometheus** option
   under **Additional Settings**. Review and select one of the available
   configurations viz. 1C (1 vCPU 4 GB RAM), 2C, 4C, or 8C.

3. Review the estimated hourly cost which should include additional charges for
   enabling Prometheus. Click **Launch** to submit changes.

### Configure your instance endpoint with Prometheus

1. For all dedicated backends with Prometheus enabled, a new endpoint called
   `/prometheus` would be available. For example, a backend at URL
   https://sudomain.region.cloud-provider.cloud.dgraph.io/graphql would expose
   metrics at URL -
   https://sudomain.region.cloud-provider.cloud.dgraph.io/prometheus

2. The `/prometheus` endpoint is protected with the **Admin API key**. Upon
   accessing the URL for this endpoint, you are prompted to enter the key. More
   information on creating an Admin API key can be found
   [here](./authentication).

3. Once you enter the Admin API token click **Submit** to launch the
   **Prometheus Dashboard**.

### Integrating with Grafana

To visualize Prometheus metrics within the **Grafana Dashboard** for Dgraph
Cloud, perform the following actions:

1. Launch the Grafana Dashboard and follow the same steps to add a **Prometheus
   Data Source** to Grafana as described
   **[here](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/#creating-a-prometheus-data-source)**
   but with the following changes:

2. Under the section **HTTP**, for the option **URL**, enter the URL for your
   Prometheus endpoint (Example -
   https://sudomain.region.cloud-provider.cloud.dgraph.io/prometheus). For the
   **Access** option select **Server (default)** from the dropdown menu.

3. Lastly, under **Auth**, within the **Custom HTTP Headers** subsection, click
   **Add Header** and add a new **Header** called `X-Auth-Token`. Enter your
   Admin API key as its **Value**. The following image shows an example data
   source configuration.

4. Click **Save & Test** to save and test the new Prometheus data source.

5. Create and populate your **Grafana Dashboard**. Select the **Prometheus Data
   Source** that was configured earlier and select the metrics to visualize (for
   example `dgraph_memory_inuse_bytes` or `dgraph_alpha_health_status`). If
   correctly configured the metrics can be visualized as below:

Your new monitoring and observability stack for Dgraph Cloud leveraging the
Prometheus and Grafana solutions should now be ready for use. The same is useful
to monitor your Dgraph backend efficiently, without the overhead of installing,
maintaining, and scaling your own observability stack.
