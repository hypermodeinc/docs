### Before you begin

Log in to [Dgraph Cloud](https://cloud.dgraph.io) using **Sign in with Google**,
**Sign in with GitHub** or any other email account that you prefer to use.

### Provision a backend

1. After you have signed up and verified you email, log into
   [Dgraph Cloud](https://cloud.dgraph.io/) and you'll arrive at the dashboard
   screen.

2. Click the **Launch New Backend** button and you'll be taken to a screen to
   enter the details of the backend.

   Name the backend, optionally set a subdomain (if left blank, Dgraph Cloud
   picks a random domain for you), and then pick a region to deploy you GraphQL
   backend to.

That's it! You now have a running Dgraph backend. Time to build an app.

The URL listed in "GraphQL Endpoint" is the URL at which Dgraph Cloud serves
data to your app.

You can copy it at any time to use in a GraphQL client app.
