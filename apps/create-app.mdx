Creating your first App in Hypermode is straightforward. This guide walks you
through the entire process from workspace creation to having a fully configured
app ready for development.

## Prerequisites

Before creating your app, ensure you have:

- A GitHub account
- Access to a repository (existing or new)
- Basic understanding of your app's requirements

## Getting started

To create your app, follow these steps in the Hypermode console. If you haven't
created a workspace yet, you'll need to do that first. Workspaces are where you
and your team manage all your apps and configurations.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create your workspace">

Start by going to [hypermode.com](https://hypermode.com) and creating your
workspace. Workspaces are where you and your team manage all your apps.

/>

Enter a descriptive name for your workspace and click **Create workspace**.
Choose a name that reflects your organization or project scope, as this becomes
the container for all your apps.

</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Apps">

Once your workspace is created, you'll see the main dashboard. Click on **Apps**
to start creating your first app.

/>

From the Apps section, you have options to create different types of apps or
import existing ones.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Your App">

Click **Import your Modus app** to create a new app. This option works whether
you're importing an existing Modus project or starting fresh.

### Define your app name

Enter a descriptive name for your app. This can be used in your app's endpoint
URL and throughout the Hypermode console.

### Connect to your GitHub repository

You have two options:

#### Option 1: use an existing repository

- Select your repository from the dropdown
- Ensure your repository has the proper Modus structure or is ready for app
  development

#### Option 2: create a new repository

If you don't have a repository yet, you can create one:

  src="/images/apps/github-create.png"
  alt="GitHub repository creation interface with repository name field"
/>

1. Choose the repository owner (your organization or personal account)
2. Enter a memorable repository name
3. Add an optional description
4. Create the repository
5. Return to the app configuration and select your newly created repository

### Deployment location

Choose your preferred deployment region. This affects:

- **Latency**: Choose a region close to your users
- **Compliance**: Select based on data residency requirements
- **Performance**: Consider where your external services are hosted

</Step>

<Step title="Complete App Creation">

After filling in all the configuration details, click **Create App**. Hypermode
then automatically:

1. Sets up your app infrastructure
2. Configures the GitHub integration
3. Generates your app's endpoint and API key
4. Prepares your development environment

</Step>

<Step title="Review your App configuration">

Once created, you'll see your app's configuration panel:

<img
  src="/images/apps/console-app.png"
  alt="App details panel showing endpoint, GitHub repository, and API key information"
/>

Your new app includes:

### Endpoint

Your production GraphQL endpoint where your app is accessible:

```text
https://your-app-name-workspace-id.hypermode.app/graphql
```

### GitHub repository

The connected repository for automatic deployments. Any push to the main branch
triggers a deployment.

### API key

Your authentication key for accessing the app's API. Keep this secure and use it
in your app headers:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Development Approaches

With your app created, you can choose between two development approaches:

### Code first development

- Use the Modus CLI locally
- Full control over app structure
- Traditional Git workflows
- See the [Develop guide](/apps/develop-app) for setup instructions

### Conversational development

- Use Threads for AI-assisted development
- Natural language app building
- Rapid prototyping and iteration
- See the Threads documentation for details

## Next steps

Now that your app is created:

1. **Set up local development** with `modus dev` (see
   [Develop guide](/apps/develop-app))
2. **Configure connections** to external services (see
   [Connect Your App guide](/apps/connect-app))
3. **Deploy your first version** by pushing to your repository (see
   [Deploy guide](/apps/deploy-app))

Your app is now ready for development. The GitHub integration is configured,
your endpoint is live, and you have everything needed to start building your
AI-powered app.

## Troubleshooting

**Repository not appearing in dropdown?**

- Ensure you have proper permissions to the repository
- Check that the Hypermode GitHub App is installed on your organization/account

**App creation failed?**

- Verify your repository is accessible
- Ensure the app name doesn't conflict with existing apps
- Check that all required fields are filled correctly

**Need to change configuration?**

- Most settings can be updated later in the app's configuration panel
- Repository connections can be modified in the app settings
