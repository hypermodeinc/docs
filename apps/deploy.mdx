"og:title": "Deploy - Apps" Deploying Apps to Production Once you've developed
and tested your App locally, you're ready to deploy it to production on
Hypermode. Hypermode provides a seamless deployment pipeline that takes your
Modus code and makes it available as a scalable, production-ready service.
Prerequisites Before deploying, ensure you have:

- A Modus app with a valid modus.json configuration
- Authentication with Hypermode via the Hyp CLI
- A linked GitHub repository (for automatic deployments) Authentication Setup
  First, authenticate with Hypermode using the Hyp CLI:

# Install the Hyp CLI if you haven't already

npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli

# Log into your Hypermode account

hyp login This opens your browser and authenticates you with Hypermode, storing
your credentials locally for future deployments. Linking Your Repository To
enable automatic deployments, link your Modus app repository to Hypermode:

# Navigate to your Modus app directory

cd my-modus-app

# Link the repository to Hypermode

hyp link This process:

- Connects your GitHub repository to your Hypermode workspace
- Sets up the necessary webhooks for automatic deployments
- Creates a Hypermode app linked to your repository Deployment Methods Automatic
  Deployment via Git The recommended approach is automatic deployment through
  Git. When you link your repository, Hypermode automatically deploys your app
  when you push to the main branch.

# Make your changes and commit them

git add . git commit -m "Update app logic"

# Push to trigger deployment

git push origin main Manual Deployment For immediate deployments or testing, you
can deploy directly from your local environment:

# Deploy your current working directory

modus deploy

# Deploy a specific branch

modus deploy --branch feature-branch

# Deploy with custom environment variables

modus deploy --env production Deployment Configuration Environment Variables
Configure environment variables for your production deployment in your
modus.json: { "connections": { "external-api": { "type": "http", "baseUrl":
"https://api.example.com/", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}" }
} } } Set production environment variables through the Hypermode console or via
the CLI:

# Set environment variables for production

hyp env set API_KEY=your_production_api_key hyp env set
DATABASE_URL=your_production_db_url Build Configuration Ensure your modus.json
is properly configured for production: { "functions": "./functions", "models": {
"text-generator": { "sourceModel": "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct",
"provider": "hugging-face", "connection": "hypermode" } }, "connections": {
"hypermode": { "type": "hypermode", "host": "https://api.hypermode.com" } } }
Deployment Pipeline When you deploy, Hypermode follows this process:

1. Code Analysis: Validates your Modus configuration and code structure
2. Compilation: Compiles your Go or AssemblyScript code to WebAssembly
3. Model Setup: Configures and validates all specified AI models
4. Function Registration: Makes your functions available via GraphQL
5. Agent Deployment: Deploys any stateful agents with persistent memory
6. Health Checks: Verifies the deployment is healthy and responsive Production
   Features Automatic Scaling Your deployed Apps automatically scale based on
   demand:

- Functions: Scale to zero when not in use, instant cold starts
- Agents: Maintain persistent memory while scaling compute resources
- Models: Shared model infrastructure with automatic load balancing Built-in
  Observability Production deployments include comprehensive observability:
- Function Logs: Real-time logs for all function executions
- Performance Metrics: Response times, error rates, and throughput
- Agent Monitoring: Memory usage and state transitions
- Model Analytics: Token usage and inference performance Security and Compliance
  Production deployments are secured by default:
- Automatic HTTPS: All endpoints served over secure connections
- API Authentication: Secure API key management
- Environment Isolation: Complete separation between development and production
- Audit Logging: Complete audit trail of all deployments and changes Managing
  Deployments Viewing Deployment Status Monitor your deployments through the
  Hypermode console or CLI:

# Check deployment status

hyp status

# View recent deployments

hyp deployments list

# Get detailed logs

hyp logs --follow Rolling Back Deployments If issues arise, quickly roll back to
a previous deployment:

# List available versions

hyp deployments list

# Roll back to a specific deployment

hyp rollback --version v1.2.3

# Roll back to the previous version

hyp rollback --previous Blue-Green Deployments For zero-downtime deployments,
Hypermode supports blue-green deployment patterns:

# Deploy to staging environment

modus deploy --env staging

# Promote staging to production after testing

hyp promote staging production Custom Domains Configure custom domains for your
production Apps:

# Add a custom domain

hyp domain add api.mycompany.com

# Configure SSL certificates (automatic with Let's Encrypt)

hyp domain ssl enable api.mycompany.com CI/CD Integration For advanced
deployment workflows, integrate with your CI/CD pipeline:

# .github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Deploy to Hypermode

on: push: branches: [main]

jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'

      - name: Install Hyp CLI
        run: npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli

      - name: Deploy to Hypermode
        run: modus deploy
        env:
          HYP_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.HYP_API_KEY }}

Production Best Practices Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate model sizes for your use case
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Monitor memory usage in stateful agents Security
- Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
- Implement proper input validation Monitoring
- Set up alerts for error rates and performance degradation
- Monitor agent memory usage and state persistence
- Track model inference costs and usage patterns
- Implement health checks for critical dependencies Cost Management
- Monitor token usage for AI models
- Use appropriate compute resources for your workload
- Implement rate limiting to prevent unexpected costs
- Consider model selection based on cost vs. performance trade-offs
  Troubleshooting Deployments Common Issues Build Failures

# Check build logs

hyp logs --build

# Validate configuration locally

modus build --validate Environment Variable Issues

# List current environment variables

hyp env list

# Test with local environment

modus dev --env production-like Model Configuration Problems

# Test model connections

hyp models test

# Check model availability

hyp models list --available Getting Help If you encounter deployment issues:

- Check the deployment troubleshooting guide
- View real-time logs in the Hypermode console
- Contact support through the Hypermode dashboard
- Join the community Discord for peer support Your Apps are now ready for
  production use, with automatic scaling, built-in observability, and
  enterprise-grade security. The deployment process ensures your Modus code runs
  reliably in a production environment while maintaining the same development
  experience you're familiar with locally.
