Once you've developed and tested your App locally, you're ready to deploy it to
production on Hypermode. This guide walks you through creating an app in the
Hypermode console and deploying your Modus code.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- A completed Modus app (see the [Develop guide](/develop) for setup)
- A GitHub account and repository

## Step 1: Create Your Workspace

First, go to [hypermode.com](https://hypermode.com) and create your workspace.

  alt="Create workspace interface showing workspace name input field"
/>

Enter a name for your workspace and click "Create workspace". Workspaces are
where you and your team manage apps in Hypermode.

## Step 2: Create a New App

From the dashboard, click on "Apps":

<img
  src="/images/apps/console-2.png"
  alt="Hypermode dashboard showing Apps option"
/>

Click "Import your Modus app" to start creating your app.

## Step 3: Configure Your App

Fill in the app configuration details:

<img
  src="/images/apps/app-create.png"
  alt="Import Modus app configuration form with app name, GitHub repository, and location fields"
/>

Configure your app settings:

- **Modus app name**: Enter your app name (e.g., `my-modus-app`)
- **GitHub Repository**: Select your existing repository from the dropdown
- **Modus app location**: Choose your deployment region (e.g., Portland)

If you don't have a repository yet, you can create one first.

## Step 4: Create Your GitHub Repository (if needed)

If you need to create a new repository:

<img
  src="/images/apps/github-create.png"
  alt="GitHub repository creation interface with repository name field"
/>

Fill in your repository details:

- Choose the repository owner (your organization or personal account)
- Enter a memorable repository name (e.g., `my-modus-app`)
- Add an optional description

Then return to the app configuration and select your newly created repository.

## Step 5: View Your App Configuration

Once your app is created, you'll see your app's configuration:

Once your app is created, you'll see your app's configuration:

<img
  src="/images/apps/console-3.png"
  alt="App details panel showing endpoint, GitHub repository, and API key information"
/>

Your app is now configured with:

- **Endpoint**: Your production GraphQL endpoint
- **GitHub repository**: Connected repository for deployments
- **API key**: Authentication key for your app

## Deployment Options

You have two ways to deploy your app to Hypermode:

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment via GitHub Actions

Add a GitHub Actions workflow to your repository for automatic deployments.

Create `.github/workflows/ci-modus-build.yml`:

```yaml
name: ci-modus-build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "22"

      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: "1.23.1"

      - name: Setup TinyGo
        uses: acifani/setup-tinygo@v2
        with:
          tinygo-version: "0.34.0"

      - name: Build project
        run: npx -p @hypermode/modus-cli -y modus build
```

Once the workflow is added, **any push to the `main` branch automatically
deploys your app**:

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy my Modus app"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Deploy with Hyp CLI

You can also deploy directly using the Hyp CLI for immediate deployments:

```bash
# Install the Hyp CLI
npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli

# Login to Hypermode
hyp login

# Deploy your current app
hyp deploy
```

The Hyp CLI deployment:

- Builds your app locally
- Uploads it directly to Hypermode
- Provides immediate feedback and logs
- Useful for testing or urgent deployments

Both methods automatically:

1. Build your Modus app via GitHub Actions or locally
2. Deploy to your Hypermode endpoint
3. Make your functions available via GraphQL

Deployment output:

```
üöÄ Deployment started for commit abc123d
üì¶ Building application...
‚úì Functions compiled successfully
üåê Deploying to production...
‚úì Health checks passed
üéâ Deployment complete!

Endpoint: https://my-modus-app-my-workspace-hurx1.hypermode.app/graphql
```

## Production Features

Your deployed app includes:

- **Automatic scaling**: Functions scale to zero when not in use
- **HTTPS endpoints**: Secure GraphQL API
- **Bearer token auth**: API key authentication
- **Real-time logs**: Monitor function execution in the Activity tab
- **Environment variables**: Manage secrets and configuration

  alt="Activity logs showing function execution history"
/>

## Managing Your Deployment

### Viewing Function Activity

Monitor your function executions in the Activity tab:

<img
  src="/images/apps/console-5.png"
  alt="Function logs showing execution times and status"
/>

You can see:

- Function execution history
- Response times and duration
- Success/error status
- Execution timestamps

### Environment Variables

Configure environment variables in the Environment variables tab:

<img
  src="/images/apps/console-6.png"
  alt="Environment variables configuration panel"
/>

Set production environment variables for:

- API keys and secrets
- Database connection strings
- Feature flags
- External service configurations

## Testing Your Deployment

Test your deployed functions via GraphQL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app-endpoint.hypermode.app/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ sayHello(name: \"Production\") }"}'
```

## Next Steps

With your app deployed, your development workflow becomes:

1. Develop and test locally with `modus dev`
2. Commit and push changes to GitHub
3. Automatic deployment to production
4. Monitor via Hypermode console

Your Modus app is now live and ready to handle production traffic with automatic
scaling, built-in observability, and secure endpoints.
