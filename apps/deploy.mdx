Once you've developed and tested your App locally, you're ready to deploy it to
production on Hypermode. Hypermode provides a seamless deployment pipeline that
takes your Modus code and makes it available as a scalable, production-ready
service.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- A Modus app with a valid `modus.json` configuration
- A GitHub account and repository
- The Modus CLI installed (`npm install -g @hypermode/modus-cli`)

## Getting Started with Hypermode

First, go to [hypermode.com](https://hypermode.com) and create your workspace by
connecting to a GitHub repository.

### Step 1: Create Your Workspace

Navigate to Hypermode and create a new workspace. Workspaces are where you and
your team get things done in Hypermode.

  alt="Create workspace interface showing workspace name input field"
/>

Enter a name for your workspace and click "Create workspace" to continue.

### Step 2: Choose Your Development Path

After creating your workspace, you'll see the main dashboard with options to get
started:

<img
  src="/images/apps/console-2.png"
  alt="Hypermode dashboard showing three options: Apps, Graphs, and Model router"
/>

Click on "Apps" and then "Import your Modus app" to connect your existing
repository or create a new one.

### Step 3: Connect Your GitHub Repository

Create a new repository or import an existing one. If you're starting fresh, you
can create a new repository directly from Hypermode:

<img
  src="/images/apps/github-create.png"
  alt="GitHub repository creation interface with repository name field and template options"
/>

Fill in your repository details:

- Choose the repository owner (your organization or personal account)
- Enter a memorable repository name (e.g., `my-modus-app`)
- Add an optional description

### Step 4: App Configuration

Once your repository is connected, you'll see your app's configuration panel:

<img
  src="/images/apps/console-3.png"
  alt="App details panel showing endpoint, GitHub repository, and API key information"
/>

Your app will be automatically configured with:

- **Endpoint**: Your app's GraphQL endpoint URL
- **GitHub repository**: Link to your connected repository
- **API key**: Authentication key for your app (click to reveal)

## Local Development Setup

With your repository connected, clone it locally and set up your development
environment:

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-modus-app.git
cd my-modus-app

# Initialize a new Modus app
modus new
```

The Modus CLI will guide you through creating your app:

<img
  src="/images/apps/console-5.png"
  alt="Modus CLI interface showing SDK selection and app name input"
/>

The CLI will:

1. Let you select your preferred SDK (Go, AssemblyScript, etc.)
2. Prompt for your app name
3. Generate the initial project structure

Example output:

```
✓ Select a SDK: Go
? Pick a name for your app: my-modus-app

Creating new Modus app...
✓ Created project structure
✓ Installed dependencies
✓ Generated sample functions

Your Modus app is ready! Run 'modus dev' to start developing.
```

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

Start your development server to test your app locally:

```bash
# Start the development server
modus dev
```

This will:

- Compile your functions to WebAssembly
- Start a local GraphQL server
- Enable hot reload for rapid development
- Provide real-time logs and debugging

Example development output:

```
🚀 Starting Modus development server...
📦 Compiling functions...
✓ Compiled 3 functions successfully
🌐 GraphQL endpoint: http://localhost:8686/graphql
📊 GraphQL Playground: http://localhost:8686/
🔄 Watching for changes...

[12:34:56] INFO: Function 'generateText' loaded
[12:34:56] INFO: Function 'processData' loaded
[12:34:56] INFO: Function 'analyzeContent' loaded
[12:34:56] INFO: Development server ready
```

### Building for Production

Before deploying, ensure your app builds successfully:

```bash
# Build your app for production
modus build
```

Expected build output:

```
📦 Building Modus app for production...
🔍 Validating modus.json configuration...
✓ Configuration valid
🏗️  Compiling Go functions to WebAssembly...
✓ generateText.wasm (1.2MB)
✓ processData.wasm (890KB)
✓ analyzeContent.wasm (1.1MB)
📋 Generating function manifests...
✓ Build completed successfully

Build artifacts:
- build/functions/
- build/manifests/
- build/modus.json
```

## Deployment Methods

### Automatic Deployment via Git

The recommended approach is automatic deployment through Git. When you push to
the `main` branch, Hypermode automatically deploys your app.

```bash
# Make your changes and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Add new AI-powered function"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

Deployment logs will show:

```
🚀 Deployment started for commit abc123d
📦 Building application...
✓ Functions compiled successfully
🤖 Configuring AI models...
✓ Model connections validated
🌐 Deploying to production...
✓ Health checks passed
🎉 Deployment complete!

Endpoint: https://my-modus-app-my-workspace-hurx1.hypermode.app/graphql
```

### Manual Deployment

For immediate deployments or testing, you can deploy directly:

```bash
# Deploy your current working directory
modus deploy

# Deploy a specific branch
modus deploy --branch feature-branch

# Deploy with environment variables
modus deploy --env production
```

## Authentication Setup

For CLI deployments, authenticate with Hypermode:

```bash
# Install the Hyp CLI
npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli

# Log into your Hypermode account
hyp login
```

This opens your browser and authenticates you with Hypermode:

```
🔐 Opening login page...
✓ Authentication complete!
✓ Successfully logged in as user@example.com! 🎉
```

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure environment variables for your production deployment in your
`modus.json`:

```json
{
  "functions": "./functions",
  "models": {
    "text-generator": {
      "sourceModel": "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct",
      "provider": "hugging-face",
      "connection": "hypermode"
    }
  },
  "connections": {
    "hypermode": {
      "type": "hypermode",
      "host": "https://api.hypermode.com"
    },
    "external-api": {
      "type": "http",
      "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set production environment variables through the Hypermode console or via the
CLI:

```bash
# Set environment variables for production
hyp env set API_KEY=your_production_api_key
hyp env set DATABASE_URL=your_production_db_url
```

## Deployment Pipeline

When you deploy, Hypermode follows this process:

1. **Code Analysis**: Validates your Modus configuration and code structure

   ```
   🔍 Analyzing code structure...
   ✓ modus.json configuration valid
   ✓ Function signatures verified
   ✓ Dependencies resolved
   ```

2. **Compilation**: Compiles your Go or AssemblyScript code to WebAssembly

   ```
   🏗️  Compiling functions...
   ✓ generateText.go → generateText.wasm
   ✓ processData.go → processData.wasm
   ✓ All functions compiled successfully
   ```

3. **Model Setup**: Configures and validates all specified AI models

   ```
   🤖 Setting up AI models...
   ✓ text-generator model configured
   ✓ Model endpoints validated
   ✓ Connection to Hypermode established
   ```

4. **Function Registration**: Makes your functions available via GraphQL

   ```
   📡 Registering GraphQL endpoints...
   ✓ generateText → Query.generateText
   ✓ processData → Mutation.processData
   ✓ GraphQL schema generated
   ```

5. **Health Checks**: Verifies the deployment is healthy and responsive
   ```
   🏥 Running health checks...
   ✓ Endpoint responding (200ms)
   ✓ Model connections active
   ✓ Function execution test passed
   ```
