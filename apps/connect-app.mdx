Apps become powerful when they can connect to external systems. Hypermode
supports connecting your app to APIs, databases, and model providers through
secure, manageable integrations.

## Connection Examples

### OpenAI API connection

Connect to OpenAI for language models:

```json modus.json
{
  "models": {
    "text-generator": {
      "sourceModel": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "connection": "openai",
      "path": "v1/chat/completions"
    }
  },
  "connections": {
    "openai": {
      "type": "http",
      "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### PostgreSQL database

Connect to a PostgreSQL database:

```json modus.json
{
  "connections": {
    "postgres": {
      "type": "postgresql",
      "connStr": "{{DATABASE_URL}}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Dgraph database

Connect to a Dgraph database for graph operations:

```json modus.json
{
  "connections": {
    "dgraph": {
      "type": "dgraph",
      "grpcTarget": "{{DGRAPH_ENDPOINT}}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment variables

### Naming convention

Hypermode uses a consistent naming pattern for environment variables:
`MODUS_<CONNECTION_NAME>_<PLACEHOLDER>`

For a connection named `openai` with placeholder `{{API_KEY}}`:

- Environment variable: `MODUS_OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Local development

Set environment variables in `.env.dev.local`:

```text .env.dev.local
MODUS_OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
MODUS_POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"
MODUS_DGRAPH_DGRAPH_ENDPOINT="localhost:9080"
```

### Production environment

Configure production environment variables in the Hypermode console:

<img
  src="/images/apps/console-envs.png"
  alt="Environment variables configuration panel"
/>

1. Navigate to your app in the console
2. Click on the **Environment Variables** tab
3. Add your environment variables with the proper naming convention
4. Save the configuration

## Testing connections

### Local testing

Test connections during development:

```bash
# Start development server
modus dev

# Test connections in the API Explorer
# Navigate to http://localhost:8686/explorer
```

### Production testing

Verify connections in production:

```bash
# Test your deployed app's connections
curl -X POST https://your-app-endpoint.hypermode.app/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ testConnection }"}'
```

## Best practices

- **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- **Use least privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions to API tokens
- **Test locally first**: Use `modus dev` to debug connection issues before
  deploying
- **Monitor usage**: Track API calls and database connections in production

Your app can now securely connect to external services and databases.
