User management allows anyone in the organization to invite more users.

### Inviting a User to an Organization

You can invite a new user to join your organization by sending an email invitation. Follow the steps below:

1. **Select the Organization**  
   Navigate to the top-level navigation bar and select the organization to which you want to invite the user.

2. **Navigate to the Users Tab**  
   Once in the organization’s scope, select the **Users** tab from the horizontal navigation.

3. **Invite a New User**  
   Click the **Invite User** button. In the dialog that appears, enter the email address of the user you wish to invite.

4. **Send the Invitation**  
   After entering the email address, click the **Invite** button to send the invitation. The user will now be listed as **Pending**.

### Managing Pending Invitations

After sending an invitation, the user will appear as **Pending** in the user list. You have the following options to manage pending invitations:

- **Resend Invitation**: If the user did not receive or lost the initial invitation, click the **Resend** button next to the user’s entry to send a new invitation.
- **Revoke Invitation**: If you need to cancel an invitation before the user accepts it, click the **Revoke** button to remove the invitation.

### User Status and Access

Once the invited user accepts the invitation, their status will change from **Pending** to **Active**, and they will gain access to the organization based on the permissions you have configured.
