User management allows anyone in the organization to invite more users.

### Inviting a user to an organization

You can invite a new user to join your organization by sending an email invitation. Follow the steps below:

1. **Select the organization**  
   Navigate to the top-level navigation bar and select the organization to which you want to invite the user.

2. **Navigate to the users tab**  
   Once in the organization’s scope, select the **Users** tab from the horizontal navigation.

3. **Invite a new user**  
   Click **Invite User**. In the dialog that appears, enter the email address of the user you wish to invite.

4. **Send the invitation**  
   After entering the email address, click **Invite** to send the invitation. The user will now be listed as **Pending**.

### Managing pending invitations

After sending an invitation, the user will appear as **Pending** in the user list. You have the following options to manage pending invitations:

- **Resend invitation**: If the user didn't receive or lost the initial invitation, click **Resend** next to the user’s entry to send a new invitation.
- **Revoke invitation**: If you need to cancel an invitation before the user accepts it, click **Revoke** to remove the invitation.

### User status and access

Once the invited user accepts the invitation, their status will no longer be **Pending** and they will gain access to the organization.
