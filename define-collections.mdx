title: Define Collections
description: "Enable natural language search"

Collections are a key integration aspect with [models](/define-models) to create smart, searchable text.
The `collections` object in the [project manifest](/manifest) allows you to define groupings of text and functions to embed inserted text with.

```json hypermode.json
{
  "collections": {
    // This defines a collection of products, having two search methods.
    "myProducts": {
      "searchMethods": {
        "searchMethod1": {
          // The embedder is the name of the function that will be used to generate vector embeddings.
          // By default, it uses a sequential index.
          "embedder": "embed"
        },

        // This is an example of a second search method.
        // It could use a different embedder or index type, if desired.
        "searchMethod2": {
          "embedder": "embed",
          "index": {
            "type": "sequential"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each collection requires a unique name, specified as a key, containing only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

## Properties

<ResponseField name="searchMethods" type="object">
  If provided, adds an index on top of the collection. Each key-value pair is a
  search method and values.

    - `embedder`: An exported function name used by the search method to
    embed text in the collection. Function must have a call signature with input `string[]` and return type `f32[][]`.
    <Accordion title="Examples">
        This example specifies a `searchMethod` with an embedder named `embed`
        ```json
        "searchMethod1": {
          "embedder": "embed"
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>

    - `index`: If provided, describes the index mechanism used by the search method.
    _By default, set to sequential indexing._
        - `type`: Specifies the type of the index. For example, "sequential".
    <Accordion title="Examples">
        This example specifies a `searchMethod` with an embedder named `embed` and an index with type `sequential`
        ```json
        "searchMethod1": {
          "embedder": "embed"
          "index": {
            "type": "sequential"
          }
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>

  </ResponseField>
