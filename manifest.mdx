The manifest in a Hypermode project allows you to configure the resources your functions have access to at runtime. You define the manifest in the `hypermode.json` file within the root of your project directory.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Models" icon="message-plus" href="/define-models">
    Define inference services for use in your functions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hosts" icon="server" href="/define-hosts">
    Establish connectivity for models and other external endpoints
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The schema for the API that serves your functions is [auto-generated based on your function signatures](/define-schema).
