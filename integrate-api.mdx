Hypermode makes it easy to incrementally add intelligence your app.

## API endpoint

You can find your project's API endpoint in the Hypermode Console in the format of `https://<slug>.hypermode.app/<endpoint>`.

## API token

Hypermode protects your project's endpoint with an API key. In your project dashboard, navigate to `Settings` â†’ `API Keys` to find and manage your API tokens.

From your app, you can call the API by passing the API token in the `Authorization` header. Here's an example using the `fetch` API in JavaScript:

```javascript
const endpoint = ""; // your API endpoint
const key = ""; // your API key
// your graphql query
const query = `query {
  ...
}`;

const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: key,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: query,
  }),
});
const data = await response.json();
```

<Note>
  Additional authorization methods are under development. If your app requires a
  different protocol, reach out at
