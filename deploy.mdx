Hypermode features a native GitHub integration for the deployment of Hypermode
projects. The deployment includes your Modus app as well as any models defined
in the [app manifest](/modus/app-manifest).

<Note>
  Preview environments for live validation of pull requests are in development.

## Link your project to GitHub

After you push your Modus app to GitHub, you can link your Hypermode project to
the repo through the Hyp CLI.

```bash
hyp link
```

## Build

When you link your project with Hypermode, the Hyp CLI adds a GitHub Actions
workflow to your repo that builds your Modus app to Hypermode on commit.

## Deploy

On successful build of your project, Hypermode automatically deploys your
project changes. For [hosted models](/hosted-models), Hypermode creates a
connection for your app to a shared or dedicated model instance.

You can view the deployment status from the Deployments tab within the Hypermode
Console.
