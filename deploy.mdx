Hypermode leverages a native GitHub integration for the deployment of Hypermode projects. The deployment includes both the project's [manifest](/modus/app-manifest) and functions.

<Note>
  Preview environments for live validation of pull requests are in development.

## Build

All templates include a GitHub Action to build your project's functions. On success, the action deploys your functions to Hypermode when committing or merging to the branch defined in the Hypermode Console.

## Deploy

On successful build of your project or a change to your manifest in your connected GitHub repository, Hypermode automatically deploys your project changes.

For [auto-deployed models](/modus/app-manifest#auto-deployed-models), Hypermode deploys a dedicated instance of the model.

## Query

Once deployed, your project becomes reachable through an API endpoint, protected by an API Token.
Pass this value as a bearer token in the `Authorization` request header when making your GraphQL API calls.

An example HTTP request:

```http
POST /graphql HTTP/1.1
Host: example.hypermode.app
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>
```

You can find the endpoint and API token in the Hypermode UI after selecting a project.

- The endpoint URL is on the `Home` page of the project.
- The API token is on the `Settings` page of the project, under the `API Keys` tab.
