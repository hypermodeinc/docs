Hypermode features a native GitHub integration for the deployment of Hypermode
projects. The deployment includes your Modus app as well as any models defined
in the [app manifest](/modus/app-manifest).

<Note>
  Preview environments for live validation of pull requests are in development.

## Link your app to GitHub

After you
[build your Modus app](/modus/quickstart#building-your-first-modus-app), you can
[create a new project](/create-project) and link it to GitHub using the
Hypermode Console or through the terminal with the Hyp CLI.

## Build

When you initialize your project with Hypermode, the Hyp CLI adds a GitHub
Actions workflow to your repo that builds your Modus app to Hypermode on commit.

## Deploy

On successful build of your project, Hypermode automatically deploys your
project changes. For [hosted models](/hosted-models), Hypermode creates a
connection for your app to a shared or dedicated model instance.

You can view the deployment status from the Deployments tab within the Hypermode
Console.
