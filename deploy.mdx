Hypermode features a native GitHub integration for the deployment of Hypermode
projects. The deployment includes your Modus app as well as any models defined
in the [app manifest](/modus/app-manifest).

<Note>
  Preview environments for live validation of pull requests are in development.

## Link your app to GitHub

After you [create a Modus app](/modus/quickstart#building-your-first-modus-app),
you can link the app to GitHub using the Hypermode Console or through the
terminal with the Hyp CLI.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hypermode Console">
    Navigate to the [**Hypermode Console**](https://hypermode.com/go) and click **New Project**.
    Connect your GitHub account when prompted and select the repository you want to import.
    Click "Import" to deploy your app.

    After project creation, Hypermode initiates a runtime for your app and establishes connections to any [**Hypermode-hosted models**](https://docs.hypermode.com/hosted-models).

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hyp CLI">
    Install the Hyp CLI via npm.

    ```bash
    npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli
    ```

    Run the following command in your terminal to import and deploy your Modus app to Hypermode. This creates your Hypermode project automatically.

    ```bash
    hyp link
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Build

When you initialize your project with Hypermode, the Hyp CLI adds a GitHub
Actions workflow to your repo that builds your Modus app to Hypermode on commit.

## Deploy

On successful build of your project, Hypermode automatically deploys your
project changes. For [hosted models](/hosted-models), Hypermode creates a
connection for your app to a shared or dedicated model instance.

You can view the deployment status from the Deployment tab within the Hypermode
Console.
