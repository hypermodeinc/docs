Hypermode leverages a native GitHub integration for the deployment of Hypermode projects. The deployment includes both the project's [manifest](/manifest) and functions.

<Note>
  Preview environments for live validation of pull requests are in development.

## Build

A GitHub Action is available in the [template project](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/template-project) to handle the build of your project's functions. This Action must complete successfully before your functions deploy.

## Deploy

On successful build of your project or a change to your manifest in your connected GitHub repository, Hypermode automatically deploys your project changes.

For [auto-deployed models](/define-models#auto-deployed-models), Hypermode deploys a dedicated instance of the model.
