Hypermode features a native GitHub integration for the deployment of Hypermode projects. The deployment includes your Modus app as well as any models defined in the [app manifest](/modus/app-manifest).

<Note>
  Preview environments for live validation of pull requests are in development.

## Build

When you initialize your project with Hypermode, the Hyp CLI adds a GitHub Actions workflow to your repo that builds your Modus app to Hypermode on commit.

## Deploy

On successful build of your project, Hypermode automatically deploys your project changes. For [hosted models](/hosted-models), Hypermode creates a connection for your app to a shared or dedicated model instance.

You can view the deployment status from the Deployment tab within the Hypermode Console.
