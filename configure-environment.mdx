## Host Secrets

In your project dashboard, navigate to Settings -> Hosts. Here you can configure secrets that are used for connecting to external hosts.

## Shared vs Dedicated Models

By default, models hosted on Hypermode run on a shared instance. All new projects use shared models. You can specify `"dedicated": true` in your `hypermode.json` to enable dedicated models:

```json
{
  ...
  "models": {
    "text-generator": {
      "sourceModel": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
      "provider": "hugging-face",
      "host": "hypermode",
      "dedicated": true
    }
  }
  ...
}
```
