On your first deployment, and when you add new hosts thereafter, you may need to
adjust the configuration of your environment for your app to be ready for
traffic.

## Host secrets

If you included parameters for Host Secrets in your
[app manifest](/modus/app-manifest), you'll need to add the parameter values in
the Hypermode Console.

From your project home, navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Hosts**. Add the values for
your defined host authentication parameters.

## Model hosting

Where available, Hypermode defaults to shared model instances. If your app
requires dedicated instances, refer to the [Hosted Models](/hosted-models)
documentation for instructions on setting up dedicated models.

## Scaling your runtime resources

We're working to make runtime scaling self-service. In the meantime, reach out
at [help@hypermode.com](mailto:help@hypermode.com) for assistance with this
request.
