description: "Define environment parameters for your app"

On your first deployment, and when you add new connections thereafter, you may
need to configure your environment for your app to be ready for traffic.

## Connection secrets

If you included parameters for Connection Secrets in your
[app manifest](/modus/app-manifest), you'll need to add the parameter values in
the Hypermode Console.

From your project home, navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Connections**. Add the
values for your defined connection authentication parameters.

## Model hosting

Where available, Hypermode defaults to shared model instances. Refer to the
[Hosted Models](/hosted-models) documentation for instructions on setting up
hosted models.

## Scaling your runtime resources

We're working to make runtime scaling self-service. In the meantime, reach out
at [help@hypermode.com](mailto:help@hypermode.com) for assistance with this
request.
