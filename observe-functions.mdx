<Warning>- function invocation logs - model inferences</Warning>

When you invoke a function within your project, Hypermode records the execution. In addition to duration, logs are available for each execution to enable integrated debugging.

## Function Runs

In your function code, you can add logs to help debug your functions:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript index.ts
console.log("This is a simple log message.");
console.debug("This is a debug message.");
console.info("This is an info message.");
console.warn("This is a warning message.");
console.error("This is an error message.");
```

```go main.go
package main

import (
	"github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/console"
)

console.Log("This is a simple log message.")
console.Debug("This is a debug message.")
console.Info("This is an info message.")
console.Warn("This is a warning message.")
console.Error("This is an error message.")
```

</CodeGroup>

In your project dashboard, navigate to the Function Runs tab to view execution logs of your functions.

## Inference History

For each model invocation, Hypermode records the model inference. This includes the input and output of the model, as well as the timestamp and duration of the inference.
