<Warning>- function invocation logs - model inferences</Warning>

When you invoke a function within your project, the service records each execution. In addition to duration, logs are available for each execution to enable integrated debugging.

To access the run history, navigate to the Function Runs tab of your project within the Hypermode Console.
