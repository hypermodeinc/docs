By leveraging embeddings and similarity search backed by a scalable vector index
developers can enable semantic and similarity-based searches, improving the
relevance of search results within their applications. This tutorial covers
implementing semantic search using Modus, Dgraph, and Hypermode hosted AI models
to add natural language or semantic search to your app using an example of
ecommerce product data.

## Semantic search overview

Semantic search focuses on understanding the meaning and context behind queries
rather than just matching keywords, using embeddings to capture semantic
relationships between concepts. Vector search serves as the technical
implementation method, converting text into numerical vector embeddings and
finding similar content through mathematical distance calculations in
multidimensional space.

Vector search is a powerful technique that transforms data (like text, images,
or audio) into numerical representations called embeddings. These embeddings
capture the semantic meaning of the content in a multi-dimensional space and
position similar items closer together. When performing a search, the query is
also converted into an embedding, and the system finds items whose embeddings
are closest to the query embedding.

This approach offers significant benefits over traditional keyword-based search,
including improved relevance by capturing context and semantics, enhanced
precision by understanding user intent, and the ability to handle complex
queries with higher accuracy. Vector search is particularly effective for
applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval
augmented generation (RAG), optimizing both efficiency and accuracy in finding
and retrieving data based on meaningful similarity rather than exact matches.
When combined with graph traversals, vector search can enable complex GraphRAG
retrieval patterns.

## The components

- **Dgraph** is a scalable graph database capable of near real-time graph
  traversals and vector search.
- **Modus** is the serverless API framework for building AI applications.
- **Hypermode** is the platform for deploying AI applications, including model
  hosting.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have:

1. Created a Dgraph instance, either hosted in the cloud or locally via Docker
   or installed via the Dgraph binary
2. Installed the Modus CLI and created a Modus app. See the
   [Modus Quickstart](modus/quickstart) to get started with Modus.

## Natural language search with Dgraph and Modus

The steps to implement natural language or semantic search with Dgraph include
defining the Dgraph connection in your Modus app manifest, selecting and
configuring an embedding model, declaring a vector index in the Dgraph DQL
schema, and using the `similar_to` DQL function to search for similar text in
vector space.

Our example app uses ecommerce product data consisting of product details to
enable semantic product search based on natural language terms.

## Declare Dgraph connection and Hypermode embedding model

First, update the Modus app manifest file `modus.json` to define the connection
to your Dgraph instance and the embedding model used to generate embeddings.
Here we're using the MiniLM model hosted by Hypermode and connecting to a
locally running Dgraph instance.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.hypermode.com/modus.json",
  "endpoints": {
    "default": {
      "type": "graphql",
      "path": "/graphql",
      "auth": "bearer-token"
    }
  },
  "models": {
    "minilm": {
      "sourceModel": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
      "connection": "hypermode",
      "provider": "hugging-face"
    }
  },
  "connections": {
    "dgraph-grpc": {
      "type": "dgraph",
      "grpcTarget": "localhost:9080"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  In order to use Hypermode hosted models in the local Modus development
  environment you'll need to use the `hyp` CLI to connect your local environment
  with your Hypermode account. See the [Using Hypermode-hosted
  models](work-locally#using-hypermode-hosted-models) docs page for more
  information.
</Note>

## Type definitions

Next, in our Modus app we define our data model using classes with decorators
for automatic serialization/deserialization. The `@json` decorator enables JSON
serialization, while `@alias` maps property names to Dgraph convention friendly
formats.

We'll be using ecommerce data so we'll create simple types defining products and
their categories.

```ts
@json
export class Product {
  @alias("Product.id")
  id!: string

  @alias("Product.title")
  title: string = ""

  @alias("Product.description")
  description: string = ""

  @alias("Product.category")
  @omitnull()
  category: Category | null = null
}

@json
export class Category {
  @alias("Category.name")
  name: string = ""
}
```

## Embedding model integration

Next, we create an embedding function that uses a transformer model (MiniLM in
this case) to convert product descriptions and search queries into vectors:

```ts
import { models } from "@hypermode/modus-sdk-as"
import { EmbeddingsModel } from "@hypermode/modus-sdk-as/models/experimental/embeddings"

const EMBEDDING_MODEL = "minilm"

export function embedText(content: string[]): f32[][] {
  const model = models.getModel<EmbeddingsModel>(EMBEDDING_MODEL)
  const input = model.createInput(content)
  const output = model.invoke(input)
  return output.predictions
}
```

## Define Dgraph schema

We declare a schema to use Dgraph's vector search capability and create an index
on the `Product.embedding` property, even though Dgraph can function without a
schema.

To define our Dgraph schema with vector indexing support we add the
`@index(hnsw)` directive to the property storing the embedding value, in this
case `Product.embedding`. We also define the other property types and node
labels.

```rdf
<Category.name>: string @index(hash) .
<Product.category>: uid @reverse .
<Product.description>: string .
<Product.id>: string @index(hash) .
<Product.embedding>: float32vector @index(hnsw) .
```

To apply this schema to our Dgraph instance we can make a POST request to the
`/alter` endpoint of our Dgraph instance:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/alter --silent --data-binary '@dqlschema.txt'
```

or use the schema tab of the Ratel interface to apply the schema.

## Define Modus mutation function

Now we're ready to create a Modus function to create data in Dgraph. Here we
create an upsert mutation that creates a product and related category in Dgraph,
without creating duplicate nodes.

This function uses the embedding model we configured in previous steps to create
an embedding of the product description and save to the `Product.embedding`
property.

```ts
const DGRAPH_CONNECTION = "dgraph-grpc"

/**
 * Add or update a new product to the database
 */
export function upsertProduct(product: Product): Map<string, string> | null {
  let payload = buildProductMutationJson(DGRAPH_CONNECTION, product)

  const embedding = embedText([product.description])[0]
  payload = addEmbeddingToJson(payload, "Product.embedding", embedding)

  const mutation = new dgraph.Mutation(payload)
  const response = dgraph.executeMutations(DGRAPH_CONNECTION, mutation)

  return response.Uids
}
```

<Note>
  Refer to the full code
  [here](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus-recipes/tree/main/dgraph-101) for
  how to implement other Dgraph mutation and query functions and associated
  Dgraph helpers.
</Note>

## Dgraph `similar_to` query function

Next, we create a Modus function that uses Dgraph's `similar_to` query function
that leverages the vector index to find semantically similar products by
computing an embedding of the search term and searching for nearby product
descriptions in vector space.

```ts
/**
 * Search products by similarity to a given text
 */
export function searchProducts(search: string): Product[] {
  const embedding = embedText([search])[0]
  const topK = 3
  const body = `
    Product.id
    Product.description
    Product.title
    Product.category {
      Category.name
    }
  `
  return searchBySimilarity<Product>(
    DGRAPH_CONNECTION,
    embedding,
    "Product.embedding",
    body,
    topK,
  )
}

export function searchBySimilarity<T>(
  connection: string,
  embedding: f32[],
  predicate: string,
  body: string,
  topK: i32,
): T[] {
  const query = new dgraph.Query(`
    query search($vector: float32vector) {
        var(func: similar_to(${predicate},${topK},$vector))  {
            vemb as Product.embedding
            dist as math((vemb - $vector) dot (vemb - $vector))
            score as math(1 - (dist / 2.0))
        }

        list(func:uid(score),orderdesc:val(score))  @filter(gt(val(score),0.25)){
            ${body}
        }
    }`).withVariable("$vector", embedding)

  const response = dgraph.executeQuery(connection, query)
  console.log(response.Json)
  return JSON.parse<ListOf<T>>(response.Json).list
}
```

## Query Modus endpoint

We can run our Modus app using the `modus dev` command which generates a GraphQL
schema from the functions we've defined and start a local GraphQL endpoint for
testing and development.

Navigate to `http://localhost:8686/explorer` in your browser and use the Modus
API Explorer to first insert sample data into Dgraph using the upsert mutation
function we defined previously and then search for similar products using vector
search.

First, to create product and category nodes:

```graphql
mutation ($product: ProductInput!) {
  upsertProduct(product: $product) {
    key
    value
  }
}
```

We'll use the following values for the `product` variable creating three product
nodes ad their associated category nodes in Dgraph:

| Product ID | Title                   | Description                                                                                        | Category           |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| P001       | Solar-Powered Umbrella  | A stylish umbrella with solar panels that charge your devices while you walk.                      | Outdoor Gear       |
| P002       | Self-Warming Coffee Mug | A mug that keeps your coffee at the perfect temperature using smart heating technology.            | Kitchen Appliances |
| P003       | Smart Pillow 2.0        | A pillow that tracks your sleep patterns and plays soothing sounds to help you fall asleep faster. | Smart Home         |

![Creating products in Dgraph](images/tutorials/semantic-search/upsert.png)

And then to search for semantically similar products based on a search string we
can execute the following query, using the value of our search string for the
`$search` variable.

```graphql
query ($search: String!) {
  searchProducts(search: $search) {
    id
    title
    description
    category {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

For example, if we search using the search term "rain":

```graphql
query {
  searchProducts(search: "rain") {
    id
    title
    description
    category {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

the product search results returns our solar powered umbrella.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "searchProducts": [
      {
        "id": "P001",
        "title": "Solar-Powered Umbrella",
        "description": "A stylish umbrella with solar panels that charge your devices while you walk.",
        "category": {
          "name": "Outdoor Gear"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Even though the description of the solar powered umbrella doesn't include the
word "rain" thanks to the meaning encoded into the embedding our semantic search
process understands the association between rain and umbrella.

## Next steps

Now that we've implemented semantic search using Dgraph, Modus, and Hypermode
hosted models using the local development experience we're ready to take the
next step and deploy our project to Hypermode. See the [Deploy Project](deploy)
section for a walk through of this process.
