title: Define Models
description: ''
---

Models are a core resource for inferencing. The [project manifest](/manifest) allows you to easily define models whether hosted by Hypermode or another host.

```hypermode.json
{
  "models": [
    {
        "name": "sentiment-classifier",
        "task": "classification",
        "sourceModel": "distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased",
        "provider": "hugging-face",
        "host": "hypermode"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Properties

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  Internal name of your model. Used for indicating the model to use in an API call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="task" type="string" required>
  Training intent of model, such as `classification` or `embedding`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sourceModel" type="string" required>
  Relative path of model within provider.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="provider" type="string" required>
  Source location of model, such as `hugging-face` or `openai`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="host" type="string" required>
  Runtime provider of model.
  <Expandable title="host types">
    <ResponseField name="hypermode" type="string">
      Dynamically deployed models on Hypermode.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="custom" type="string">
      Fine-tuned models on Hypermode.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="..." type="string">
      Name of a project-defined [host](/define-hosts).
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Auto-Deployed Models

When using `hugging-face` as the `provider` and `hypermode` as the `host`, Hypermode automatically deploys a dedicated instance of the defined `sourceModel` when deploying your project. Your project's functions securely connect to the hosted model, with no further configuration required.
