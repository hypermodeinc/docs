Hypermode includes a set of shared models available for integration into your
app on a pay-per-token basis.

Need a bespoke model? You can include a model from
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) in your
[app manifest](/modus/app-manifest) and Hypermode runs and manages it for you.

## Setup

To use a Hypermode-hosted model, set `connection: "hypermode"`,
`provider: "hugging-face"`, and set `sourceModel` to be the model name as
specified on Hugging Face.

```json modus.json {3-7}
{
  ...
  "models": {
    "text-generator": {
      "sourceModel": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
      "provider": "hugging-face",
      "connection": "hypermode"
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

## Deployment mode

We run our most popular models as multi-tenant, shared instances across projects
and customers.

By default, if the model you use is available as a shared model, your app uses
these shared models at runtime. If the model you use isn't available as a shared
model, Hypermode automatically spins up a dedicated instance of the model for
your project.

## Shared models

These are the models available currently with shared instances:

- [`meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
- [`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- [`AntoineMC/distilbart-mnli-github-issues`](https://huggingface.co/AntoineMC/distilbart-mnli-github-issues)
- [`distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)

<note>
  We're constantly evaluating model usage in determining new models to add to
  our shared catalog. Interested in consuming an open source model not listed
  here by the token? Let us know at
