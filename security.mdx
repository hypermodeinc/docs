At Hypermode, we take security seriously. This document outlines our approach to data handling, privacy, and security best practices to ensure your projects are safe and secure.

## Data handling and privacy

We are committed to protecting your data and privacy. Here are some key practices we follow:

- **Data Encryption**: All data transmitted between your application and our servers is encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
- **Access Control**: We implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to your data.
- **Data Minimization**: We collect only the data that is necessary for the operation of our services and retain it only as long as needed.

For more detailed information on our data handling and privacy policies, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://hypermode.com/privacy).

## Security best practices

Security is a shared responsibility. To help you keep your projects secure, we recommend the following best practices:

- **Use Strong Passwords**: ensure that all user accounts use strong, unique passwords
- **Regularly Update Dependencies**: keep your project dependencies up-to-date to avoid vulnerabilities
- **Monitor for Security Alerts**: use tools to monitor your codebase for security vulnerabilities and address them promptly

## Reporting security issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Hypermode, please let us know immediately. We have a dedicated security team that will investigate and address any reported issues.

- **Email**: Send your report to [security@hypermode.com](mailto:security@hypermode.com).
