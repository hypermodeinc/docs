At Hypermode, we take security seriously. This document outlines our approach to data handling,
privacy, and security best practices to ensure your projects are safe and secure.

## Data handling and privacy

Hypermode maintains a strong commitment to protecting your data and privacy. For detailed
information on our data handling and privacy policies, please refer to our
[Privacy Policy](https://hypermode.com/privacy).

## Security best practices

Security is a shared responsibility. To help you keep your projects secure, we recommend the
following best practices:

- **Use strong passwords**: ensure that all user accounts use strong, unique passwords
- **Develop secure apps**: implement security and quality coding best practices in the code you
  write and deploy
- **Regularly update dependencies**: keep your project dependencies up-to-date to avoid
  vulnerabilities
- **Monitor for security alerts**: use tools to monitor your codebase for security vulnerabilities
  and address them promptly
- **Manage roles and permissions**: add and remove users from your organization as your team members
  change

## Reporting security issues

We take the security of Hypermode and our open source projects very seriously. If you believe you
have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know right away.

We investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Please report any
issues or vulnerabilities via Github Security Advisories instead of posting a public issue in
GitHub. You can also send security communications to security@hypermode.com.

Please include the version identifier and details on how the you can exploit the vulnerability.

We appreciate your help in keeping Hypermode secure.
