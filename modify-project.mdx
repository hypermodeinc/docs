After you create a project, you can modify its name and slug through the project settings.

## Update project name

Your project name is a display name only and changing it doesn't impact your running app. To update
your project display name, click **Settings** → **General**. Enter a new name and click **Save**.

## Update project slug

From your project view, click **Settings** → **General**. Enter a new slug and click **Save**.

<Warning>
  If you update the project slug, you must update any existing integrations that
  use the existing app endpoints. Make sure to communicate these changes with
  your team or stakeholders.
</Warning>

## Delete project

If you no longer need a project, you can permanently delete it. Deleting a project removes all
associated endpoints, configurations, and data.

To delete a project, from the project in the console, click **Settings** → **Delete**. Click
**Delete** and enter the project’s name as confirmation. This action is irreversible and permanently
deletes all project data and configuration.
