<Warning>
  - what is Hypermode? - key features and benefits - primary concepts (project,
  deployment, API, hosting, storage "everything you need to run your AI APIs")
</Warning>

Hypermode is a platform for building and hosting AI features and assistants for your applications. It aims to include or integrate with everything you need to ship real-time APIs that combine AI and your application logic. We've created an open source framework to make that even easier: [Modus](github.com/hypermodeinc/modus). 

The Hypermode API is organized around [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/). Our platform automatically generates a managed GraphQL endpoint for the functions you write. Hypermode can securely connect to models via HTTPS as well as host models for you.
