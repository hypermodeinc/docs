Hypermode provides the workbench and infrastructure to create **powerful**, **engaging**, and **secure** AI assistants, APIs, and services.

With every push to git, Hypermode automatically builds and deploys your functions. It creates a live, scalable API for you to preview, test, and promote to production.

## Quick Install

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -sSL http://install.hypermode.com/hyp.sh | bash
```

```js npm
npm install -g @hypermode/hyp
```

</CodeGroup>

## What's Hypermode?

Hypermode is a series of services and tools for developers to build and host their AI models, data, and logic. We're the best place to build and host [Modus](/modus/overview) applications.

### Functions

Hypermode combined with Modus provides an AWS Lambda alternative for building functions and APIs, powered by WebAssembly. Functions are the building blocks of your app as small, reusable pieces of code that you use to perform a single task. You combine functions to create more complex applications.

### Infrastructure

#### Compute

- Serverless Function Invocation:

  - GraphQL API: Hypermode provides a managed GraphQL API for each project invoking your functions, paying only for the compute time you use.

- Model Hosting:
  - [Shared Models](/hosted-models#shared-models_): Hypermode includes a set of shared models available for integration into your app on a pay-per-token basis.
  - [Dedicated Models](/hosted-models): Hypermode can also spin up a dedicated instances of your preferred models on a per project basis.
  - [Secure Model Connection](/modus/sdk/models#models): Hypermode provides secure connections to externally hosted models over HTTPS using the [Modus Models SDK](/modus/sdk/models#import-from-the-sdk).

#### Storage

- [Collections](/modus/app-manifest#collections): Collections are a lightweight way to store and retrieve data in Hypermode, similar to tables in a database.
- Databases:
  - Hosted Dgraph: (Coming Soon) Hypermode provides a hosted Dgraph database for your applications.
  - External Databases: Hypermode can securely connect to your existing databases to provide data to your functions.

### Management

The Hypermode console gives developers and administrators a single place to manage all aspects of their AI applications and models.

- [Project Management](/modify-project)
- [User Management](/user-management)
- [Function and Inference Observability](/observe-functions)
