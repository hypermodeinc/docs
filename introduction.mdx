Hypermode is a framework for building AI features and assistants for your applications. The easy-to-use [Functions SDK](/sdk/functions-sdk) combines with a powerful runtime to allow you to put your first features into production within hours, no data required.

Don't stop there. Launch your project quickly with a large language model, while automatically building a training dataset to fine-tune a small, open source model. Hypermode addresses the AI orchestration needs of app developers for day one and beyond.
