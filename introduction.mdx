Hypermode is a platform for building and hosting intelligent APIs that integrate AI features and assistants into your app.

With [Modus](github.com/hypermodeinc/modus), we've created an open source serverless framework that allows for incremental and portable development of functions and APIs, powered by WebAssembly. Start by writing your functions and types. Seamlessly integrate AI models. Modus automatically generates your API for easy integration into your app.
